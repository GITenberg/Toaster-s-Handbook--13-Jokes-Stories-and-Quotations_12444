<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Nothing so frightens a man as the announcement that he is
expected to respond to a toast on some appallingly near-by
occasion. All ideas he may ever have had on the subject melt away
and like a drowning man he clutches furiously at the nearest solid
object. This book is intended for such rescue purpose, buoyant and
trustworthy but, it is to be hoped, not heavy.</p>
<p>Let the frightened toaster turn first to the key word of his
topic in this dictionary alphabet of selections and perchance he
may find toast, story, definition or verse that may felicitously
introduce his remarks. Then as he proceeds to outline his talk and
to put it into sentences, he may find under one of the many subject
headings a bit which will happily and scintillatingly drive home
the ideas he is unfolding.</p>
<p>While the larger part of the contents is humorous, there are
inserted many quotations of a serious nature which may serve as
appropriate literary ballast.</p>
<p>The jokes and quotes gathered for the toaster have been placed
under the subject headings where it seemed that they might be most
useful, even at the risk of the joke turning on the compilers. To
extend the usefulness of such pseudo-cataloging, cross references,
similar and dissimilar to those of a library card catalog, have
been included.</p>
<p>Should a large number of the inclusions look familiar, let us
remark that the friends one likes best are those who have been
already tried and trusted and are the most welcome in times of
need. However, there are stories of a rising generation, whose
acquaintance all may enjoy.</p>
<p>Nearly all these new and old friends have before this made their
bow in print and since it rarely was certain where they first
appeared, little attempt has been made to credit any source for
them. The compilers hereby make a sweeping acknowledgment to the
"funny editors" of many books and periodicals.</p>

<h2>ON THE POSSESSION OF A SENSE OF HUMOR</h2>
<p>"Man," says Hazlitt, "is the only animal that laughs and weeps,
for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference
between what things are and what they ought to be." The sources,
then, of laughter and tears come very close together. At the
difference between things as they are and as they ought to be we
laugh, or we weep; it would depend, it seems, on the point of view,
or the temperament. And if, as Horace Walpole once said, "Life is a
comedy to those who think, a tragedy to those who feel," it is the
thinking half of humanity that, at the sight of life's
incongruities, is moved to laughter, the feeling half to tears. A
sense of humor, then, is the possession of the thinking half, and
the humorists must be classified at once with the thinkers.</p>
<p>If one were asked to go further than this and to give offhand a
definition of humor, or of that elusive quality, a sense of humor,
he might find himself confronted with a difficulty. Yet certain
things about it would be patent at the outset: Women haven't it;
Englishmen haven't it; it is the chiefest of the virtues, for tho a
man speak with the tongues of men and of angels, if he have not
humor we will have none of him. Women may continue to laugh over
those innocent and innocuous incidents which they find amusing; may
continue to write the most delightful of stories and
essays&mdash;consider Jane Austen and our own Miss
Repplier&mdash;over which appreciative readers may continue to
chuckle; Englishmen may continue, as in the past to produce the
most exquisite of the world's humorous literature&mdash;think of
Charles Lamb&mdash;yet the fundamental faith of mankind will remain
unshaken: women have no sense of humor, and an Englishman cannot
see a joke! And the ability to "see a joke" is the infallible
American test of the sense of humor.</p>
<p>But taking the matter seriously, how would one define humor?
When in doubt, consult the dictionary, is, as always, an excellent
motto, and, following it, we find that our trustworthy friend,
Noah Webster, does not fail us. Here is his definition of humor,
ready to hand: humor is "the mental faculty of discovering,
expressing, or appreciating ludicrous or absurdly incongruous
elements in ideas, situations, happenings, or acts," with the
added information that it is distinguished from wit as
"less purely intellectual and having more kindly sympathy
with human nature, and as often blended with pathos." A friendly
rival in lexicography defines the same prized human attribute more
lightly as "a facetious turn of thought," or more specifically in
literature, as "a sportive exercise of the imagination that is
apparent in the choice and treatment of an idea or theme."
Isn't there something about that word "sportive," on the
lips of so learned an authority, that tickles the
fancy&mdash;appeals to the sense of humor?</p>
<p>Yet if we peruse the dictionary further, especially if we
approach that monument to English scholarship, the great Murray, we
shall find that the problem of defining humor is not so simple as
it might seem; for the word that we use so glibly, with so sure a
confidence in its stability, has had a long and varied history and
has answered to many aliases. When Shakespeare called a man
"humorous" he meant that he was changeable and capricious, not that
he was given to a facetious turn of thought or to a "sportive"
exercise of the imagination. When he talks in "The Taming of the
Shrew" of "her mad and head-strong humor" he doesn't mean to imply
that Kate is a practical joker. It is interesting to note in
passing that the old meaning of the word still lingers in the verb
"to humor." A woman still humors her spoiled child and her
cantankerous husband when she yields to their capriciousness. By
going hack a step further in history, to the late fourteenth
century, we met Chaucer's physician who knew "the cause of everye
maladye, and where engendered and of what humour" and find that
Chaucer is not speaking of a mental state at all, but is referring
to those physiological humours of which, according to Hippocrates,
the human body contained four: blood, phlegm, bile, and black bile,
and by which the disposition was determined. We find, too, that at
one time a "humour" meant any animal or plant fluid, and again any
kind of moisture. "The skie hangs full of humour, and I think we
shall haue raine," ran an ancient weather prophet's prediction.
Which might give rise to some thoughts on the paradoxical subject
of <i>dry</i> humor.</p>
<p>Now in part this development is easily traced. Humor, meaning
moisture of any kind, came to have a biological significance and
was applied only to plant and animal life. It was restricted later
within purely physiological boundaries and was applied only to
those "humours" of the human body that controlled temperament. From
these fluids, determining mental states, the word took on a
psychological coloring, but&mdash;by what process of evolution did
humor reach its present status! After all, the scientific method
has its weaknesses!</p>
<p>We can, if we wish, define humor in terms of what it is not. We
can draw lines around it and distinguish it from its next of kin,
wit. This indeed has been a favorite pastime with the jugglers of
words in all ages. And many have been the attempts to define humor,
to define wit, to describe and differentiate them, to build high
fences to keep them apart.</p>
<p>"Wit is abrupt, darting, scornful; it tosses its analogies in
your face; humor is slow and shy, insinuating its fun into your
heart," says E. P. Whipple. "Wit is intellectual, humor is
emotional; wit is perception of resemblance, humor of
contrast&mdash;of contrast between ideal and fact, theory and
practice, promise and performance," writes another authority. While
yet another points out that "Humor is feeling&mdash;feelings can
always bear repetition, while wit, being intellectual, suffers by
repetition." The truth of this is evident when we remember that we
repeat a witty saying that we may enjoy the effect on others, while
we retell a humorous story largely for our own enjoyment of it.</p>
<p>Yet it is quite possible that humor ought not to be defined. It
may be one of those intangible substances, like love and beauty,
that are indefinable. It is quite probable that humor should not be
explained. It would be distressing, as some one pointed out, to
discover that American humor is based on American dyspepsia. Yet
the philosophers themselves have endeavored to explain it. Hazlitt
held that to understand the ludicrous, we must first know what the
serious is. And to apprehend the serious, what better course could
be followed than to contemplate the serious&mdash;yes and
ludicrous&mdash;findings of the philosophers in their attempts to
define humor and to explain laughter. Consider Hobbes: "The passion
of laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from the
sudden conception of eminency in ourselves by comparison with the
inferiority of others, or with our own formerly." According to
Professor Bain, "Laughter results from the degradation of some
person or interest possessing dignity in circumstances that excite
no other strong emotion." Even Kant, desisting for a time from his
contemplation of Pure Reason, gave his attention to the human
phenomenon of laughter and explained it away as "the result of an
expectation which of a sudden ends in nothing." Some modern cynic
has compiled a list of the situations on the stage which are always
"humorous." One of them, I recall, is the situation in which the
clown-acrobat, having made mighty preparations for jumping over a
pile of chairs, suddenly changes his mind and walks off without
attempting it. The laughter that invariably greets this "funny"
maneuver would seem to have philosophical sanction. Bergson, too,
the philosopher of creative evolution, has considered laughter to
the extent of an entire volume. A reading of it leaves one a little
disturbed. Laughter, so we learn, is not the merry-hearted, jovial
companion we had thought him. Laughter is a stern mentor,
characterized by "an absence of feeling." "Laughter," says M.
Bergson, "is above all a corrective, it must make a painful
impression on the person against whom it is directed. By laughter
society avenges itself for the liberties taken with it. It would
fail in its object if it bore the stamp of sympathy or kindness."
If this be laughter, grant us occasionally the saving grace of
tears, which may be tears of sympathy, and, therefore, kind!</p>
<p>But, after all, since it is true that "one touch of humor makes
the whole world grin," what difference does it make what that humor
is; what difference why or wherefore we laugh, since somehow or
other, in a sorry world, we do laugh?</p>
<p>Of the test for a sense of humor, it has already been said that
it is the ability to see a joke. And, as for a joke, the
dictionary, again a present help in time of trouble, tells us at
once that it is, "something said or done for the purpose of
exciting a laugh." But stay! Suppose it does not excite the laugh
expected? What of the joke that misses fire? Shall a joke be judged
by its intent or by its consequences? Is a joke that does not
produce a laugh a joke at all? Pragmatically considered it is not.
Agnes Repplier, writing on Humor, speaks of "those beloved writers
whom we hold to be humorists because they have made us laugh." We
hold them to be so&mdash;but there seems to be a suggestion that we
may be wrong. Is it possible that the laugh is not the test of the
joke? Here is a question over which the philosophers may wrangle.
Is there an Absolute in the realm of humor, or must our jokes be
judged solely by the pragmatic test? Congreve once told Colly
Gibber that there were many witty speeches in one of Colly's plays,
and many that looked witty, yet were not really what they seemed at
first sight! So a joke is not to be recognized even by its
appearance or by the company it keeps. Perhaps there might be
established a test of good usage. A joke would be that at which the
best people laugh.</p>
<p>Somebody&mdash;was it Mark Twain?&mdash;once said that there are
eleven original jokes in the world&mdash;that these were known in
prehistoric times, and that all jokes since have been but
modifications and adaptations from the originals. Miss Repplier,
however, gives to modern times the credit for some inventiveness.
Christianity, she says, must be thanked for such contributions as
the missionary and cannibal joke, and for the interminable
variations of St. Peter at the gate. Max Beerbohm once codified all
the English comic papers and found that the following list
comprised all the subjects discussed: Mothers-in-law; Hen-pecked
husbands; Twins; Old maids; Jews; Frenchmen and Germans; Italians
and Niggers; Fatness; Thinness; Long hair (in men); Baldness; Sea
sickness; Stuttering; Bloomers; Bad cheese; Red noses. A like
examination of American newspapers would perhaps result in a
slightly different list. We have, of course, our purely local
jokes. Boston will always be a joke to Chicago, the east to the
west. The city girl in the country offers a perennial source of
amusement, as does the country man in the city. And the foreigner
we have always with us, to mix his Y's and J's, distort his H's,
and play havoc with the Anglo-Saxon Th. Indeed our great American
sense of humor has been explained as an outgrowth from the vast
field of incongruities offered by a developing civilization.</p>
<p>It may be that this vaunted national sense has been
over-estimated&mdash;exaggeration is a characteristic of that
humor, anyway&mdash;but at least it has one of the Christian
virtues&mdash;it suffereth long and is kind. Miss Repplier says
that it is because we are a "humorous rather than a witty people
that we laugh for the most part with, and not at our fellow
creatures." This, I think, is something that our fellow creatures
from other lands do not always comprehend. I listened once to a
distinguished Frenchman as he addressed the students in a western
university chapel. He was evidently astounded and embarrassed by
the outbursts of laughter that greeted his mildly humorous remarks.
He even stopped to apologize for the deficiencies of his English,
deeming them the cause, and was further mystified by the little
ripple of laughter that met his explanation&mdash;a ripple that
came from the hearts of the good-natured students, who meant only
to be appreciative and kind. Foreigners, too, unacquainted with
American slang often find themselves precipitating a laugh for
which they are unprepared. For a bit of current slang, however and
whenever used, is always humorous.</p>
<p>The American is not only a humorous person, he is a practical
person. So it is only natural that the American humor should be put
to practical uses. It was once said that the difference between a
man with tact and a man without was that the man with tact, in
trying to put a bit in a horse's mouth, would first tell him a
funny story, while the man without tact would get an axe. This use
of the funny story is the American way of adapting it to practical
ends. A collection of funny stories used to be an important part of
a drummer's stock in trade. It is by means of the "good story" that
the politician makes his way into office; the business man paves
the way for a big deal; the after-dinner speaker gets a hearing;
the hostess saves her guests from boredom. Such a large place does
the "story" hold in our national life that we have invented a
social pastime that might be termed a "joke match." "Don't tell a
funny story, even if you know one," was the advice of the Atchison
Globe man, "its narration will only remind your hearers of a bad
one." True as this may be, we still persist in telling our funny
story. Our hearers are reminded of another, good or bad, which
again reminds us&mdash;and so on.</p>
<p>A sense of humor, as was intimated before, is the chiefest of
the virtues. It is more than this&mdash;it is one of the essentials
to success. For, as has also been pointed out, we, being a
practical people, put our humor to practical uses. It is held up as
one of the prerequisites for entrance to any profession. "A
lawyer," says a member of that order, must have such and such
mental and moral qualities; "but before all else"&mdash;and this
impressively&mdash;"he must possess a sense of humor." Samuel
McChord Crothers says that were he on the examining board for the
granting of certificates to prospective teachers, he would place a
copy of Lamb's essay on Schoolmasters in the hands of each, and if
the light of humorous appreciation failed to dawn as the reading
progressed, the certificate would be withheld. For, before all
else, a teacher must possess a sense of humor! If it be true, then,
that the sense of humor is so important in determining the choice
of a profession, how wise are those writers who hold it an
essential for entrance into that most exacting of
professions&mdash;matrimony! "Incompatibility in humor," George
Eliot held to be the "most serious cause of diversion." And
Stevenson, always wise, insists that husband and wife must he able
to laugh over the same jokes&mdash;have between them many a "grouse
in the gun-room" story. But there must always be exceptions if the
spice of life is to be preserved, and I recall one couple of my
acquaintance, devoted and loyal in spite of this very
incompatibility. A man with a highly whimsical sense of humor had
married a woman with none. Yet he told his best stories with an eye
to their effect on her, and when her response came, peaceful and
placid and non-comprehending, he would look about the table with
delight, as much as to say, "Isn't she a wonder? Do you know her
equal?"</p>
<p>Humor may be the greatest of the virtues, yet it is the one of
whose possession we may boast with impunity. "Well, that was too
much for my sense of humor," we say. Or, "You know my sense of
humor was always my strong point." Imagine thus boasting of one's
integrity, or sense of honor! And so is its lack the one vice of
which one may not permit himself to be a trifle proud. "I admit
that I have a hot temper," and "I know I'm extravagant," are simple
enough admissions. But did any one ever openly make the confession,
"I know I am lacking in a sense of humor!" However, to recognize
the lack one would first have to possess the sense&mdash;which is
manifestly impossible.</p>
<p>"To explain the nature of laughter and tears is to account for
the condition of human life," says Hazlitt, and no philosophy has
as yet succeeded in accounting for the condition of human life.
"Man is a laughing animal," wrote Meredith, "and at the end of
infinite search the philosopher finds himself clinging to laughter
as the best of human fruit, purely human, and sane, and
comforting." So whether it be the corrective laughter of Bergson,
Jove laughing at lovers' vows, Love laughing at locksmiths, or the
cheerful laughter of the fool that was like the crackling of thorns
to Koheleth, the preacher, we recognize that it is good; that
without this saving grace of humor life would be an empty vaunt. I
like to recall that ancient usage: "The skie hangs full of humour,
and I think we shall haue raine." Blessed humor, no less refreshing
today than was the humour of old to a parched and thirsty
earth.</p>

<br />
<h2>TOASTERS, TOASTMASTERS AND TOASTS</h2>
<p>Before making any specific suggestions to the prospective
toaster or toastmaster, let us advise that he consider well the
nature and spirit of the occasion which calls for speeches. The
toast, after-dinner talk, or address is always given under
conditions that require abounding good humor, and the desire to
make everybody pleased and comfortable as well as to furnish
entertainment should be uppermost.</p>
<p>Perhaps a consideration of the ancient custom that gave rise to
the modern toast will help us to understand the spirit in which a
toast should be given. It originated with the pagan custom of
drinking to gods and the dead, which in Christian nations was
modified, with the accompanying idea of a wish for health and
happiness added. In England during the sixteenth century it was
customary to put a "toast" in the drink, which was usually served
hot. This toast was the ordinary piece of bread scorched on both
sides. Shakespeare in "The Merry Wives of Windsor" has Falstaff
say, "Fetch me a quart of sack and put a toast in't." Later the
term came to be applied to the lady in whose honor the company
drank, her name serving to flavor the bumper as the toast flavored
the drink. It was in this way that the act of drinking or of
proposing a health, or the mere act of expressing good wishes or
fellowship at table came to be known as toasting.</p>
<p>Since an occasion, then, at which toasts are in order is one
intended to promote good feeling, it should afford no opportunity
for the exploitation of any personal or selfish interest or for
anything controversial, or antagonistic to any of the company
present. The effort of the toastmaster should be to promote the
best of feeling among all and especially between speakers. And
speakers should cooperate with the toastmaster and with each other
to that end. The introductions of the toastmaster may, of course,
contain some good-natured bantering, together with compliment, but
always without sting. Those taking part may "get back" at the
toastmaster, but always in a manner to leave no hard feeling
anywhere. The toastmaster should strive to make his speakers feel
at ease, to give them good standing with their hearers without
overpraising them and making it hard to live up to what is expected
of them. In short, let everybody boost good naturedly for everybody
else.</p>
<p>The toastmaster, and for that matter everyone taking part,
should be carefully prepared. It may be safely said that those who
are successful after-dinner speakers have learned the need of
careful forethought. A practised speaker may appear to speak
extemporaneously by putting together on one occasion thoughts and
expressions previously prepared for other occasions, but the
neophyte may well consider it necessary to think out carefully the
matter of what to say and how to say it. Cicero said of Antonius,
"All his speeches were, <i>in appearance</i>, the unpremeditated
effusion of an honest heart; and yet, in reality, they were
<i>preconceived with so much skill</i> that the judges were not so
well prepared as they should have been to withstand the force of
them!"</p>
<p>After considering the nature of the occasion and getting himself
in harmony with it, the speaker should next consider the relation
of his particular subject to the occasion and to the subjects of
the other speakers. He should be careful to hold closely to the
subject allotted to him so that he will not encroach upon the
ground of other speakers. He should be careful, too, not to
appropriate to himself any of their time. And he should consider,
without vanity and without humility, his own relative importance
and govern himself accordingly. We have all had the painful
experience of waiting in impatience for the speech of the evening
to begin while some humble citizen made "a few introductory
remarks."</p>
<p>In planning his speech and in getting it into finished form, the
toaster will do well to remember those three essentials to all good
composition with which he struggled in school and college days,
Unity, Mass and Coherence. The first means that his talk must have
a central thought, on which all his stories, anecdotes and jokes
will have a bearing; the second that there will be a proper balance
between the parts, that it will not be all introduction and
conclusion; the third, that it will hang together, without awkward
transitions. A toast may consist, as Lowell said, of "a platitude,
a quotation and an anecdote," but the toaster must exercise his
ingenuity in putting these together.</p>
<p>In delivering the toast, the speaker must of course be natural.
The after-dinner speech calls for a conversational tone, not for
oratory of voice or manner. Something of an air of detachment on
the part of the speaker is advisable. The humorist who can tell a
story with a straight face adds to the humorous effect.</p>
<p>A word might be said to those who plan the program. In the
number of speakers it is better to err in having too few than too
many. Especially is this true if there is one distinguished person
who is <i>the</i> speaker of the occasion. In such a case the number
of lesser lights may well be limited to two or three. The placing of
the guest of honor on the program is a matter of importance.
Logically he would be expected to come last, as the crowning
feature. But if the occasion is a large semi-public affair&mdash;a
political gathering, for example&mdash;where strict etiquet does
not require that all remain thru the entire program, there will
always be those who will leave early, thus missing the best part of
the entertainment. In this case some shifting of speakers, even at
the risk of an anti-climax, would be advisable. On ordinary
occasions, where the speakers are of much the same rank, order will
be determined mainly by subject. And if the topics for discussion
are directly related, if they are all component parts of a general
subject, so much the better.</p>
<p>Now we are going to add a special paragraph for the absolutely
inexperienced person&mdash;who has never given, or heard anyone
else give, a toast. It would seem hardly possible in this day of
banquets to find an individual who has missed these occasions
entirely&mdash;but he is to be found. Especially is this true in a
world where toasting and after-dinner speaking are coming to be
more and more in demand at social functions&mdash;the college
world. Here the young man or woman, coming from a country town
where the formal banquet is unknown, who has never heard an
after-dinner speech, may be confronted with the necessity of
responding to a toast on, say "Needles and Pins." Such a one would
like to be told first of all what an after-dinner speech is. It is
only a short, informal talk, usually witty, at any rate kindly,
with one central idea and a certain amount of illustrative material
in the way of anecdotes, quotations and stories. The best advice to
such a speaker is: Make your first effort simple. Don't be over
ambitious. If, as was suggested in the example cited a moment ago,
the subject is fanciful&mdash;as it is very apt to be at a college
banquet&mdash;any interpretation you choose to put upon it is
allowable. If the interpretation is ingenious, your case is already
half won. Such a subject is in effect a challenge. "Now, let's see
what you can make of this," is what it implies. First get an idea;
then find something in the way of illustrative material. Speak
simply and naturally and sit down and watch how the others do it.
Of course the subject on such occasions is often of a more serious
nature&mdash;Our Class; The Team; Our President&mdash;in which case
a more serious treatment is called for, with a touch of honest
pride and sentiment.</p>
<p>To sum up what has been said, with borrowings from what others
have said on the subject, the following general rules have been
formulated:</p>
<p><i>Prepare carefully</i>. Self-confidence is a valuable
possession, but beware of being too sure of yourself. Pride goes
before a fall, and overconfidence in his ability to improvise has
been the downfall of many a would-be speaker. The speaker should
strive to give the effect of spontaneity, but this can be done only
with practice. The toast calls for the art that conceals art.</p>
<p><i>Let your speech have unity</i>. As some one has pointed out,
the after-dinner speech is a distinct form of expression, just as
is the short story. As such it should give a unity of impression.
It bears something of the same relation to the oration that the
short story does to the novel.</p>
<p><i>Let it have continuity</i>. James Bryce says: "There is a
tendency today to make after-dinner speaking a mere string of
anecdotes, most of which may have little to do with the subject or
with one another. Even the best stories lose their charm when they
are dragged in by the head and shoulders, having no connection with
the allotted theme. Relevance as well as brevity is the soul of
wit."</p>
<p><i>Do not grow emotional or sentimental</i>. American traditions
are largely borrowed from England. We have the Anglo-Saxon
reticence. A parade of emotion in public embarrasses us. A simple
and sincere expression of feeling is often desirable in a
toast&mdash;but don't overdo it.</p>
<p><i>Avoid trite sayings</i>. Don't use quotations that are
shopworn, and avoid the set forms for toasts&mdash;"Our sweethearts
and wives&mdash;may they never meet," etc.</p>
<p><i>Don't apologise</i>. Don't say that you are not prepared;
that you speak on very short notice; that you are "no orator as
Brutus is." Resolve to do your best and let your effort speak for
itself.</p>
<p><i>Avoid irony and satire</i>. It has already been said that
occasions on which toasts are given call for friendliness and good
humor. Yet the temptation to use irony and satire may be strong.
Especially may this be true at political gatherings where there is
a chance to grow witty at the expense of rivals. Irony and satire
are keen-edged tools; they have their uses; but they are dangerous.
Pope, who knew how to use them, said:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Satire's my weapon, but I'm too discreet</p>
<p class="i2">To run amuck and tilt at all I meet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Use personal references sparingly</i>. A certain amount of
good-natured chaffing may be indulged in. Yet there may be danger
in even the most kindly of fun. One never knows how a jest will be
taken. Once in the early part of his career, Mark Twain, at a New
England banquet, grew funny at the expense of Longfellow and
Emerson, then in their old age and looked upon almost as
divinities. His joke fell dead, and to the end of his life he
suffered humiliation at the recollection.</p>
<p><i>Be clear</i>. While you must not draw an obvious moral or
explain the point to your jokes, be sure that the point is there
and that it is put in such a way that your hearers cannot miss it.
Avoid flights of rhetoric and do not lose your anecdotes in a sea
of words.</p>
<p><i>Avoid didacticism</i>. Do not try to instruct. Do not give
statistics and figures. They will not be remembered. A historical
resume of your subject from the beginning of time is not called
for; neither are well-known facts about the greatness of your city
or state or the prominent person in whose honor you may be
speaking. Do not tell your hearers things they already know.</p>
<p><i>Be brief</i>. An after-dinner audience is in a particularly
defenceless position. It is so out in the open. There is no
opportunity for a quiet nod or two behind a newspaper or the hat of
the lady in front. If you bore your hearers by overstepping your
time politeness requires that they sit still and look pleased.
Spare them. Remember Bacon's advice to the speaker: "Let him be
sure to leave other men their turns to speak." But suppose you come
late on the program! Suppose the other speakers have not heeded
Bacon? What are you going to do about it? Here is a story that
James Bryce tells of the most successful after-dinner speech he
remembers to have heard. The speaker was a famous engineer, the
occasion a dinner of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science. "He came last; and midnight had arrived. His toast was
Applied Science, and his speech was as follows: 'Ladies and
gentlemen, at this late hour I advise you to illustrate the
Applications of Science by applying a lucifer match to the wick of
your bedroom candle. Let us all go to bed'."</p>
<p>If you are capable of making a similar sacrifice by cutting
short your own carefully-prepared, wise, witty and sparkling
remarks, your audience will thank you&mdash;and they may ask you to
speak again.</p>

<h3>ACTING</h3>
<p>Hopkinson Smith tells a characteristic story of a southern
friend of his, an actor, who, by the way, was in the dramatization
of <i>Colonel Carter</i>. On one occasion the actor was appearing
in his native town, and remembered an old negro and his wife, who
had been body servants in his father's household, with a couple of
seats in the theatre. As it happened, he was playing the part of
the villain, and was largely concerned with treasons, stratagems
and spoils. From time to time he caught a glimpse of the ancient
couple in the gallery, and judged from their fearsome countenance
and popping eyes that they were being duly impressed.</p>
<p>After the play he asked them to come and see him behind the
scenes. They sat together for a while in solemn silence, and then
the mammy resolutely nudged her husband. The old man gathered
himself together with an effort, and said: "Marse Cha'les, mebbe it
ain' for us po' niggers to teach ouh young masser 'portment. But we
jes' got to tell yo' dat, in all de time we b'long to de fambly,

<h3>ACTORS AND ACTRESSES</h3>
<p>An "Uncle Tom's Cabin" company was starting to parade in a small
New England town when a big gander, from a farmyard near at hand
waddled to the middle of the street and began to hiss.</p>
<p>One of the double-in-brass actors turned toward the fowl and
angrily exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Don't be so dern quick to jump at conclusions. Wait till you
see the show."&mdash;<i>K.A. Bisbee</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>When William H. Crane was younger and less discreet he had a
vaunting ambition to play <i>Hamlet</i>. So with his first profits
he organized his own company and he went to an inland western town
to give vent to his ambition and "try it on."</p>
<p>When he came back to New York a group of friends noticed that
the actor appeared to be much downcast.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Crane? Didn't they appreciate it?" asked one
of his friends.</p>
<p>"They didn't seem to," laconically answered the actor.</p>
<p>"Well, didn't they give any encouragement? Didn't they ask you
to come before the curtain?" persisted the friend.</p>
<p>"Ask me?" answered Crane. "Man, they dared me!"</p>

<p>LEADING MAN IN TRAVELING COMPANY&mdash;"We play <i>Hamlet</i>

<p>SUB-MANAGER&mdash;"Why?"</p>
<p>LEADING MAN&mdash;"I have four days' growth upon my chin. One

<p>The hero of the play, after putting up a stiff fight with the
villain, had died to slow music.</p>
<p>The audience insisted on his coming before the curtain.</p>
<p>He refused to appear.</p>
<p>But the audience still insisted.</p>
<p>Then the manager, a gentleman with a strong accent, came to the
front.</p>

complacently.</p>
<p>"But," returned Mrs. Fiske, "look at me&mdash;think how I have

<p>Orlando Day, a fourth-rate actor in London, was once called, in
a sudden emergency, to supply the place of Allen Ainsworth at the
Criterion Theatre for a single night.</p>
<p>The call filled him with joy. Here was a chance to show the
public how great a histrionic genius had remained unknown for lack
of an opportunity. But his joy was suddenly dampened by the
dreadful thought that, as the play was already in the midst of its
run, none of the dramatic critics might be there to watch his
triumph.</p>
<p>A bright thought struck him. He would announce the event.
Rushing to a telegraph office, he sent to one of the leading
critics the following telegram: "Orlando Day presents Allen
Ainsworth's part to-night at the Criterion."</p>
<p>Then it occurred to him, "Why not tell them all?" So he repeated
the message to a dozen or more important persons.</p>
<p>At a late hour of the same day, in the Garrick Club, a lounging
gentleman produced one of the telegrams, and read it to a group of
friends. A chorus of exclamations followed the reading: "Why, I got
precisely the same message!" "And so did I." "And I, too." "Who is
Orlando Day?" "What beastly cheek!" "Did the ass fancy that one
would pay any attention to his wire?"</p>
<p>J. M. Barrie, the famous author and playwright, who was present,
was the only one who said nothing.</p>
<p>"Didn't he wire you too?" asked one of the group.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes."</p>
<p>"But of course you didn't answer."</p>
<p>"Oh, but it was only polite to send an answer after he had taken
the trouble to wire me. So, of course, I answered him."</p>
<p>"You did! What did you say?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I just telegraphed him: 'Thanks for timely warning.'"</p>

it:</p>

<p>Pausing to listen he heard the young woman trying to play one of
Chopin's nocturnes, and not succeeding very well.</p>
<p>Paderewski walked up to the house and knocked. Miss Jones came

in and he sat down and played the nocturne as only Paderewski can,
afterward spending an hour in correcting her mistakes. Miss Jones
thanked him and he departed.</p>
<p>Some months afterward he returned to the town, and again took
the same walk.</p>

passing Daly's Theatre, and paused to look at the pictures of
Hitchcock and his company that adorned the entrance. Near the
pictures was a billboard covered with laudatory extracts from
newspaper criticisms of the show.</p>
<p>When Foy had moodily read to the bottom of the list, he turned
to an unobtrusive young man who had been watching him out of the
corner of his eye.</p>
<p>"Say, have you seen this show?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Sure," replied the young man.</p>
<p>"Any good? How's this guy Hitchcock, anyhow?"</p>
<p>"Any good?" repeated the young man pityingly. "Why, say, he's
the best in the business. He's got all these other would-be
side-ticklers lashed to the mast. He's a scream. Never laughed so
much at any one in all my life."</p>
<p>"Is he as good as Foy?" ventured Foy hopefully.</p>
<p>"As good as Foy!" The young man's scorn was superb. "Why, this
Hitchcock has got that Foy person looking like a gloom. They're not
in the same class. Hitchcock's funny. A man with feelings can't
compare them. I'm sorry you asked me, I feel so strongly about
it."</p>
<p>Eddie looked at him very sternly and then, in the hollow tones
of a tragedian, he said:</p>
<p>"I am Foy."</p>
<p>"I know you are," said the young man cheerfully. "I'm
Hitchcock!"</p>

<p>Advertisements are of great use to the vulgar. First of all, as
they are instruments of ambition. A man that is by no means big
enough for the Gazette, may easily creep into the advertisements;
by which means we often see an apothecary in the same paper of news
with a plenipotentiary, or a running footman with an
ambassador.&mdash;<i>Addison</i>.</p>

<h3>ADVICE</h3>
<p>Her exalted rank did not give Queen Victoria immunity from the
trials of a grandmother. One of her grandsons, whose recklessness
in spending money provoked her strong disapproval, wrote to the
Queen reminding her of his approaching birthday and delicately
suggesting that money would be the most acceptable gift. In her own
hand she answered, sternly reproving the youth for the sin of
extravagance and urging upon him the practise of economy. His reply
staggered her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dear Grandma," it ran, "thank you for your kind letter of
advice. I have sold the same for five pounds."</p>

<p>"I was up in Rockland County last summer, and there was a
banquet given at a country hotel. All the farmers were there and
all the village characters. I was asked to make a speech.</p>
<p>"'Now,' said I, with the usual apologetic manner, 'it is not
fair to you that the toastmaster should ask me to speak. I am
notorious as the worst public speaker in the State of New York. My
reputation extends from one end of the state to the other. I have
no rival whatever, when it comes&mdash;' I was interrupted by a
lanky, ill-clad individual, who had stuck too close to the beer
pitcher.</p>
<p>"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'I take 'ception to what this here man
says. He ain't the worst public speaker in the state. I am. You all
know it, an' I want it made a matter of record that I took
'ception.'</p>
<p>"'Well, my friend,' said I, 'suppose we leave it to the guests.
You sit down while I say my piece, and then I'll sit down and let
you give a demonstration.' The fellow agreed and I went on. I
hadn't gone far when he got up again.</p>
<p>"''S all right,' said he, 'you win; needn't go no farther!'"</p>

<p>Mark Twain and Chauncey M. Depew once went abroad on the same
ship. When the ship was a few days out they were both invited to a
dinner. Speech-making time came. Mark Twain had the first chance.
He spoke twenty minutes and made a great hit. Then it was Mr.
Depew's turn.</p>
<p>"Mr. Toastmaster and Ladies and Gentlemen," said the famous
raconteur as he arose, "Before this dinner Mark Twain and myself
made an agreement to trade speeches. He has just delivered my
speech, and I thank you for the pleasant manner in which you
received it. I regret to say that I have lost the notes of his
speech and cannot remember anything he was to say."</p>
<p>Then he sat down. There was much laughter. Next day an
Englishman who had been in the party came across Mark Twain in the
smoking-room. "Mr Clemens," he said, "I consider you were much
imposed upon last night. I have always heard that Mr. Depew is a
clever man, but, really, that speech of his you made last night
struck me as being the most infernal rot."</p>

previous generation for more years than they can remember. In view,
therefore, of his advanced age, it was with surprise that his
employer received one day an application for a few days off, in
order that the old fellow might, as he put it, "go up to de ole
State of Virginny" to see his aunt.</p>
<p>"Your aunt must be pretty old," was the employer's comment.</p>
<p>"Yassir," said Joshua. "She's pretty ole now. I reckon she's
'bout a hundred an' ten years ole."</p>
<p>"One hundred and ten! But what on earth is she doing up in
Virginia?"</p>

of twenty roses for the young woman. The florist himself filled the
order, and, thinking to improve on it, said to his clerk:</p>

Bigelow was then ninety-two, and Dr. Mitchell eighty.</p>
<p>The conversation turned to the subject of age. "I attribute my
many years," said Dr. Bigelow, "to the fact that I have been most
abstemious. I have eaten sparingly, and have not used tobacco, and
have taken little exercise."</p>
<p>"It is just the reverse in my case," explained Dr. Mitchell. "I
have eaten just as much as I wished, if I could get it; I have
always used tobacco, immoderately at times; and I have always taken
a great deal of exercise."</p>

<p>In certain parts of the west, where without irrigation the

rejoicing in one of these precipitations of moisture, when his

<h3>AMERICANS</h3>
<p>Eugene Field was at a dinner in London when the conversation

<p>It was the general opinion that a large percentage of Americans
met death at the end of a rope. Finally the hostess turned to Field
and asked:</p>
<p>"You, sir, must have often seen these affairs?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Field, "hundreds of them."</p>
<p>"Oh, do tell us about a lynching you have seen yourself," broke
in half a dozen voices at once.</p>
<p>"Well, the night before I sailed for England," said Field, "I
was giving a dinner at a hotel to a party of intimate friends when
a colored waiter spilled a plate of soup over the gown of a lady at
an adjoining table. The gown was utterly ruined, and the gentlemen
of her party at once seized the waiter, tied a rope around his
neck, and at a signal from the injured lady swung him into the
air."</p>
<p>"Horrible!" said the hostess with a shudder. "And did you
actually see this yourself?"</p>

<h3>ANCESTRY</h3>
<p>A western buyer is inordinately proud of the fact that one of
his ancestors affixed his name to the Declaration of Independence.
At the time the salesman called, the buyer was signing a number of
checks and affixed his signature with many a curve and flourish.
The salesman's patience becoming exhausted in waiting for the buyer
to recognize him, he finally observed:</p>
<p>"You have a fine signature, Mr. So-and-So."</p>
<p>"Yes," admitted the buyer, "I should have. One of my forefathers
signed the Declaration of Independence."</p>
<p>"So?" said the caller, with rising inflection. And then he
added:</p>
<p>"Vell, you aind't got nottings on me. One of my forefathers
signed the Ten Commandments."</p>

there was enough hand-clapping to arouse the troupe's dejected

act and bowed profoundly. Still the clapping continued.</p>

laughing heartily. "Well, what do you think of that?" asked the
actor, throwing out his chest.</p>

<p>As he sat on the grass eating pie, the major sauntered up in
undress uniform. The sentry, not recognizing him, did not salute,
and the major stopped and said:</p>
<p>"What's that you have there?"</p>
<p>"Pie," said the sentry, good-naturedly. "Apple pie. Have a
bite?"</p>
<p>The major frowned.</p>
<p>"Do you know who I am?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No," said the sentry, "unless you're the major's groom."</p>
<p>The major shook his head.</p>
<p>"Guess again," he growled.</p>
<p>"The barber from the village?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>

<p>The battle was going against him. The commander-in-chief,
himself ruler of the South American republic, sent an aide to the

hour&mdash;still no regiment. The aide came tearing back hatless,
breathless.</p>
<p>"My regiment! My regiment! Where is it? Where is it?" shrieked

<p>"What are you eating?" demanded the colonel.</p>
<p>"Persimmons, sir."</p>
<p>"Good Heavens! Haven't you got any more sense than to eat
persimmons at this time of the year? They'll pucker the very

<p>In certain sections of West Virginia there is no liking for
automobilists, as was evidenced in the case of a Washingtonian who
was motoring in a sparsely settled region of the State.</p>
<p>This gentleman was haled before a local magistrate upon the
complaint of a constable. The magistrate, a good-natured man, was
not, however, absolutely certain that the Washingtonian's car had
been driven too fast; and the owner stoutly insisted that he had
been progressing at the rate of only six miles an hour.</p>
<p>"Why, your Honor," he said, "my engine was out of order, and I
was going very slowly because I was afraid it would break down
completely. I give you my word, sir, you could have walked as fast
as I was running."</p>
<p>"Well," said the magistrate, after due reflection, "you don't
appear to have been exceeding the speed limit, but at the same time
you must have been guilty of something, or you wouldn't be here. I
fine you ten dollars for loitering."&mdash;<i>Fenimore

<p>"The first night that I arrived, a dinner party was given.
Feeling very enthusiastic over the recent flights, I began to tell
the young woman who was my partner at the table of some of the
details of the aviation sport.</p>
<p>"It was not until the dessert was brought on that I realized
that I had been doing all the talking; indeed, the young woman
seated next me had not uttered a single word since I first began
talking about aviation. Perhaps she was not interested in the
subject, I thought, although to an enthusiast like me it seemed
quite incredible.</p>
<p>"'I am afraid I have been boring you with this shop talk," I
said, feeling as if I should apologize.</p>

would you mind telling me, what is aviation?'"&mdash;<i>M.A.

badge," she directed her maid. "I have forgotten it. You will know
it, Addie&mdash;blue ribbon and gold lettering."</p>
<p>"Yas'm, I knows it right well." Addie could not read, but she
knew a blue ribbon with gold lettering when she saw it, and
therefore had not trouble in finding it and fastening it properly
on the dress of her mistress.</p>
<p>At the meeting Mrs. Philpots was too busy greeting her friends
to note that they smiled when they shook hands with her. When she
reached home supper was served, so she went directly to the

<h3>BALDNESS</h3>

<h3>BANKS AND BANKING</h3>
<p>During a financial panic, a German farmer went to a bank for
some money. He was told that the bank was not paying out money, but
was using cashier's checks. He could not understand this, and
insisted on money.</p>
<p>The officers took him in hand, one after another, with little
effect. At last the president tried his hand, and after long and
minute explanation, some inkling of the situation seemed to be
dawning on the farmer's mind. Much encouraged, the president said:
"You understand now how it is, don't you, Mr.. Schmidt?"</p>
<p>"I t'ink I do," admitted Mr. Schmidt. "It's like dis, aindt it?
Ven my baby vakes up at night and vants some milk, I gif him a milk
ticket."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>She advanced to the paying teller's window and, handing in a
check for fifty dollars, stated that it was a birthday present from
her husband and asked for payment. The teller informed her that she
must first endorse it.</p>
<p>"I don't know what you mean," she said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"Why, you see," he explained, "you must write your name on the
back, so that when we return the check to your husband, he will
know we have paid you the money."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that all?" she said, relieved.... One minute
elapses.</p>
<p>Thus the "endorsement": "Many thanks, dear, I've got the money.
Your loving wife, Evelyn."</p>

<p>FRIEND&mdash;"So you're going to make it hot for that fellow who
held up the bank, shot the cashier, and got away with the ten
thousand?"</p>

<p>Newell Dwight Hillis, the now famous New York preacher and
author, some years ago took charge of the First Presbyterian Church
of Evanston, Illinois. Shortly after going there he required the
services of a physician, and on the advice of one of his
parishioners called in a doctor noted for his ability properly to
emphasize a good story, but who attended church very rarely. He
proved very satisfactory to the young preacher, but for some reason
could not be induced to render a bill. Finally Dr. Hillis, becoming
alarmed at the inroads the bill might make in his modest stipend,
went to the physician and said, "See here, Doctor, I must know how
much I owe you."</p>
<p>After some urging, the physician replied: "Well, I'll tell you
what I'll do with you, Hillis. They say you're a pretty good
preacher, and you seem to think I am a fair doctor, so I'll make
this bargain with you. I'll do all I can to keep you out of heaven

"Oh, Kirstie," he said, "I've lost me weskit." They hunted high and
low, but finally as night settled down decided that the waves must
have carried it out to sea.</p>
<p>The next year, at about the same season, the two again visited
the town. And while Kirstie sold her wool in the town, Sandy

<h3>BAZARS</h3>
<p>Once upon a time a deacon who did not favor church bazars was
going along a dark street when a footpad suddenly appeared, and,
pointing his pistol, began to relieve his victim of his money.</p>
<p>The thief, however, apparently suffered some pangs of remorse.
"It's pretty rough to be gone through like this, ain't it, sir?" he
inquired.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right, my man," the "held-up" one answered
cheerfully. "I was on my way to a bazar. You're first, and there's
an end of it."</p>

<p>A western politician tells the following story as illustrating

the country.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival at one of the small towns in South Dakota,
where he was to make a speech the following day, he found that the
so-called hotel was crowded to the doors. Not having telegraphed
for accommodations, the politician discovered that he would have to
make shift as best he could. Accordingly, he was obliged for that
night to sleep on a wire cot which had only some blankets and a
sheet on it. As the politician is an extremely fat man, he found
his improvised bed anything but comfortable.</p>
<p>"How did you sleep?" asked a friend in the morning.</p>
<p>"Fairly well," answered the fat man, "but I looked like a waffle

generous man. You might try him."</p>
<p>The tramp approached Bishop Talbot confidently. The others
watched with interest. They saw a look of surprise come over the

troubled. And then, finally, they saw something pass from one hand
to the other. The tramp tried to slink past the group without
speaking, but one of them called to him:</p>
<p>"Well, did you get something from our young brother?"</p>

<p>"Do you live in this house?"</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>

figure up the stairway to the second floor.</p>
<p>"What floor do you live on?" he asked. "Is this it?"</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>Rather than face an irate wife who might, perhaps, take him for
a companion more at fault than her spouse, he opened the first door
he came to and pushed the limp figure in.</p>
<p>The good Samaritan groped his way downstairs again. As he was
passing through the vestibule he was able to make out the dim
outlines of another man, apparently in worse condition than the
first one.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" he asked. "Are you drunk, too?"</p>
<p>"Yep," was the feeble reply.</p>
<p>"Do you live in this house, too?"</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>"Shall I help you upstairs?"</p>

<p>The good Samaritan pushed, pulled, and carried him to the second
floor, where this man also said he lived. He opened the same door
and pushed him in.</p>
<p>As he reached the front door he discerned the shadow of a third
man, evidently worse off than either of the other two. He was about
to approach him when the object of his solicitude lurched out into
the street and threw himself into the arms of a passing
policeman.</p>

school. Among the items "S. P. G." figured largely and frequently.
"Darling boy," fondly exclaimed his doting mamma: "see how good he
is&mdash;always giving to the missionaries." But Tommy's sister
knew him better than even his mother did, and took the first
opportunity of privately inquiring what those mystic letters stood
for. Nor was she surprised ultimately to find that they
represented, not the venerable Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel, but "Sundries, Probably Grub."</p>

<h3>BUSINESS ENTERPRISE</h3>
<p>It happened in Topeka. Three clothing stores were on the same
block. One morning the middle proprietor saw to the right of him a
big sign&mdash;"Bankrupt Sale," and to the left&mdash;"Closing Out
at Cost." Twenty minutes later there appeared over his own door, in
larger letters, "Main Entrance."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In a section of Washington where there are a number of hotels
and cheap restaurants, one enterprising concern has displayed in
great illuminated letters, "Open All Night." Next to it was a
restaurant bearing with equal prominence the legend:</p>
<p>"We Never Close."</p>
<p>Third in order was a Chinese laundry in a little, low-framed,
tumbledown hovel, and upon the front of this building was the sign,
in great, scrawling letters:</p>
<p>"Me wakee, too."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A boy looking for something to do saw the sign "Boy Wanted"
hanging outside of a store in New York. He picked up the sign and
entered the store.</p>
<p>The proprietor met him. "What did you bring that sign in here
for?" asked the storekeeper.</p>
<p>"You won't need it any more," said the boy cheerfully. "I'm

<p>A Chinaman found his wife lying dead in a field one morning; a
tiger had killed her.</p>
<p>The Chinaman went home, procured some arsenic, and, returning to
the field, sprinkled it over the corpse.</p>
<p>The next day the tiger's dead body lay beside the woman's. The
Chinaman sold the tiger's skin to a mandarin, and its body to a
physician to make fear-cure powders, and with the proceeds he was
able to buy a younger wife.</p>

<p>A rather simple-looking lad halted before a blacksmith's shop on
his way home from school and eyed the doings of the proprietor with
much interest.</p>
<p>The brawny smith, dissatisfied with the boy's curiosity, held a
piece of red-hot iron suddenly under the youngster's nose, hoping
to make him beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>"If you'll give me half a dollar I'll lick it," said the
lad.</p>
<p>The smith took from his pocket half a dollar and held it
out.</p>
<p>The simple-looking youngster took the coin, licked it, dropped
it in his pocket and slowly walked away whistling.</p>

<p>"From each according to his ability, to each according to his
need," would seem to be the principle of the Chinese storekeeper
whom a traveler tells about. The Chinaman asked $2.50 for five
pounds of tea, while he demanded $7.50 for ten pounds of the same
brand. His business philosophy was expressed in these words of
explanation: "More buy, more rich&mdash;more rich, more can
pay!"</p>

<p>In a New York street a wagon loaded with lamp globes collided
with a truck and many of the globes were smashed. Considerable
sympathy was felt for the driver as he gazed ruefully at the
shattered fragments. A benevolent-looking old gentleman eyed him
compassionately.</p>
<p>"My poor man," he said, "I suppose you will have to make good
this loss out of your own pocket?"</p>
<p>"Yep," was the melancholy reply.</p>
<p>"Well, well," said the philanthropic old gentleman, "hold out
your hat&mdash;here's a quarter for you; and I dare say some of
these other people will give you a helping hand too."</p>
<p>The driver held out his hat and several persons hastened to drop
coins in it. At last, when the contributions had ceased, he emptied
the contents of his hat into his pocket. Then, pointing to the
retreating figure of the philanthropist who had started the
collection, he observed: "Say, maybe he ain't the wise guy! That's

<p>A political office in a small town was vacant. The office paid
$250 a year and there was keen competition for it. One of the
candidates, Ezekiel Hicks, was a shrewd old fellow, and a neat
campaign fund was turned over to him. To the astonishment of all,
however, he was defeated.</p>
<p>"I can't account for it," said one of the leaders of Hicks'
party, gloomily.</p>
<p>"With that money we should have won. How did you lay it out,
Ezekiel."</p>
<p>"Well," said Ezekiel, slowly pulling his whiskers, "yer see that
office only pays $250 a year salary, an' I didn't see no sense in
paying $900 out to get the office, so I bought a little truck farm
instead."</p>

<h3>CAPITALISTS</h3>
<p>Of the late Bishop Charles G. Grafton a Fond du Lac man said:
"Bishop Grafton was remarkable for the neatness and point of his
pulpit utterances. Once, during a disastrous strike, a capitalist
of Fond du Lac arose in a church meeting and asked leave to speak.
The bishop gave him the floor, and the man delivered himself of a
long panegyric upon captains of industry, upon the good they do by
giving men work, by booming the country, by reducing the cost of
production, and so forth. When the capitalist had finished his
self-praise and, flushed and satisfied, had sat down again, Bishop
Grafton rose and said with quiet significance: 'Is there any other
sinner that would like to say a word?'"</p>

<p>Among a party of Bostonians who spent some time in a
hunting-camp in Maine were two college professors. No sooner had
the learned gentlemen arrived than their attention was attracted by
the unusual position of the stove, which was set on posts about
four feet high.</p>
<p>This circumstance afforded one of the professors immediate
opportunity to comment upon the knowledge that woodsmen gain by
observation.</p>
<p>"Now," said he, "this man has discovered that heat emanating
from a stove strikes the roof, and that the circulation is so
quickened that the camp is warmed in much less time than would be
required were the stove in its regular place on the floor."</p>
<p>But the other professor ventured the opinion that the stove was
elevated to be above the window in order that cool and pure air
could be had at night.</p>
<p>The host, being of a practical turn, thought that the stove was
set high in order that a good supply of green wood could be placed
under it.</p>
<p>After much argument, they called the guide and asked why the
stove was in such a position.</p>
<p>The man grinned. "Well, gents," he explained, "when I brought
the stove up the river I lost most of the stove-pipe overboard; so
we had to set the stove up that way so as to have the pipe reach
through the roof."</p>

<p>Jack Barrymore, son of Maurice Barrymore, and himself an actor

thrown out of bed by one of the shocks, spun around on the floor
and left gasping in a corner. Finally, he got to his feet and
rushed for a bathtub, where he stayed all that day. Next day he
ventured out. A soldier, with a bayonet on his gun, captured
Barrymore and compelled him to pile bricks for two days.</p>
<p>Barrymore was telling his terrible experience in the Lambs' Club

pint of champagne is a great help."</p>
<p>"Indeed!" remarked Mr. Gladstone; "does a pint of champagne
really help you to answer the twenty letters?"</p>

champagne I don't care a rap whether I answer them or not."</p>

<h3>CHARACTER</h3>
<p>The Rev. Charles H. Spurgeon was fond of a joke and his keen wit
was, moreover, based on sterling common sense. One day he remarked
to one of his sons:</p>
<p>"Can you tell me the reason why the lions didn't eat
Daniel?"</p>
<p>"No sir. Why was it?"</p>
<p>"Because the most of him was backbone and the rest was
grit."</p>

<p>They were trying an Irishman, charged with a petty offense, in
an Oklahoma town, when the judge asked: "Have you any one in court
who will vouch for your good character?"</p>
<p>"Yis, your honor," quickly responded the Celt, "there's the
sheriff there."</p>
<p>Whereupon the sheriff evinced signs of great amazement.</p>
<p>"Why, your honor," declared he, "I don't even know the man."</p>
<p>"Observe, your honor," said the Irishman, triumphantly, "observe
that I've lived in the country for over twelve years an' the
sheriff doesn't know me yit! Ain't that a character for ye?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We must have a weak spot or two in a character before we can
love it much. People that do not laugh or cry, or take more of
anything than is good for them, or use anything but
dictionary-words, are admirable subjects for biographies. But we
don't care most for those flat pattern flowers that press best in

<p>"Too many of us, perhaps, misinterpret the meaning of charity as

pillar of a western church, entered in his journal:</p>

<p>"It requires a vast deal of courage and charity to be
philanthropic," remarked Sir Thomas Lipton, apropos of Andrew
Carnegie's giving. "I remember when I was just starting in
business. I was very poor and making every sacrifice to enlarge my
little shop. My only assistant was a boy of fourteen, faithful and
willing and honest. One day I heard him complaining, and with
justice, that his clothes were so shabby that he was ashamed to go
to chapel.</p>
<p>"'There's no chance of my getting a new suit this year,' he told
me. 'Dad's out of work, and it takes all of my wages to pay the
rent.'</p>
<p>"I thought the matter over, and then took a sovereign from my
carefully hoarded savings and bought the boy a stout warm suit of
blue cloth. He was so grateful that I felt repaid for my sacrifice.
But the next day he didn't come to work. I met his mother on the
street and asked her the reason.</p>
<p>"'Why, Mr. Lipton,' she said, curtsying, 'Jimmie looks so
respectable, thanks to you, sir, that I thought I would send him
around town today to see if he couldn't get a better job.'"</p>

study the type of savages about it. Just as he reached the clump he
heard a voice say: "Why in hell did you play that card?" He dropped
on his knees and, devoutly raising his hands, cried:</p>

<h3>CIRCUS</h3>
<p>A well-known theatrical manager repeats an instance of what the
late W. C. Coup, of circus fame, once told him was one of the most
amusing features of the show-business; the faking in the
"side-show."</p>
<p>Coup was the owner of a small circus that boasted among its
principal attractions a man-eating ape, alleged to be the largest
in captivity. This ferocious beast was exhibited chained to the
dead trunk of a tree in the side-show. Early in the day of the
first performance of Coup's enterprise at a certain Ohio town, a
countryman handed the man-eating ape a piece of tobacco, in the
chewing of which the beast evinced the greatest satisfaction.</p>
<p>The word was soon passed around that the ape would chew tobacco;
and the result was that several plugs were thrown at him.
Unhappily, however, one of these had been filled with cayenne
pepper. The man-eating ape bit it; then, howling with indignation,
snapped the chain that bound him to the tree, and made straight for
the practical joker who had so cruelly deceived him.</p>
<p>"Lave me at 'im!" yelled the ape. "Lave me at 'im, the dirty
villain! I'll have the rube's loife, or me name ain't
Magillicuddy!"</p>
<p>Fortunately for the countryman and for Magillicuddy, too, the
man-eating ape was restrained by the bystanders in time to prevent
a killing.</p>

<h3>CIVILIZATION</h3>
<p>An officer of the Indian Office at Washington tells of the
patronizing airs frequently assumed by visitors to the government
schools for the redskins.</p>
<p>On one occasion a pompous little man was being shown through one
institution when he came upon an Indian lad of seventeen years. The
worker was engaged in a bit of carpentry, which the visitor
observed in silence for some minutes. Then, with the utmost
gravity, he asked the boy:</p>
<p>"Are you civilized?"</p>
<p>The youthful redskin lifted his eyes from his work, calmly
surveyed his questioner, and then replied:</p>
<p>"No, are you?"&mdash;<i>Taylor Edwards</i>.</p>

<p>"Among the tenements that lay within my jurisdiction when I

efforts of the renovator of the Augean stables. And the families in
this tenement were almost as hopeless as the tenement itself.</p>
<p>"On one occasion I felt distinctly encouraged, however, since I
observed that the face of one youngster was actually clean.</p>
<p>"'William,' said I, 'your face is fairly clean, but how did you
get such dirty hands?"</p>
<p>"'Washin' me face,' said William."</p>

her contented, and among other things gave her a candy dog, with
which she played happily all day.</p>
<p>At night the dog had disappeared, and the woman inquired whether
it had been lost.</p>
<p>"No, it ain't lost," answered the little girl. "I kept it 'most

<p>One morning two of his student friends went with him. After

morning, Father Abraham."</p>

Isaac."</p>
<p>Young Hayes then made his bow and said: "Good morning Father
Jacob."</p>

<h3>COMMON SENSE</h3>
<p>A mysterious building had been erected on the outskirts of a
small town. It was shrouded in mystery. All that was known about it
was that it was a chemical laboratory. An old farmer, driving past
the place after work had been started, and seeing a man in the
doorway, called to him:</p>
<p>"What be ye doin' in this place?"</p>
<p>"We are searching for a universal solvent&mdash;something that
will dissolve all things," said the chemist.</p>
<p>"What good will thet be?"</p>
<p>"Imagine, sir! It will dissolve all things. If we want a
solution of iron, glass, gold&mdash;anything, all that we have to
do is to drop it in this solution."</p>

<p>A suburban train was slowly working its way through one of the
blizzards of 1894. Finally it came to a dead stop and all efforts
to start it again were futile.</p>
<p>In the wee, small hours of the morning a weary commuter, numb
from the cold and the cramped position in which he had tried to
sleep, crawled out of the train and floundered through the heavy
snow-drifts to the nearest telegraph station. This is the message
he handed to the operator:</p>
<p>"Will not be at office to-day. Not home yesterday yet."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A nervous commuter on his dark, lonely way home from the
railroad station heard footsteps behind him. He had an
uncomfortable feeling that he was being followed. He increased his
speed. The footsteps quickened accordingly. The commuter darted
down a lane. The footsteps still pursued him. In desperation he
vaulted over a fence and, rushing into a churchyard, threw himself
panting on one of the graves.</p>
<p>"If he follows me here," he thought fearfully, "there can be no
doubt as to his intentions."</p>
<p>The man behind was following. He could hear him scrambling over
the fence. Visions of highwaymen, maniacs, garroters and the like
flashed through his brain. Quivering with fear, the nervous one
arose and faced his pursuer.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" he demanded. "Wh-why are you following
me?"</p>
<p>"Say," asked the stranger, mopping his brow, "do you always go
home like this? I'm going up to Mr. Brown's and the man at the
station told me to follow you, as you lived next door. Excuse my
asking you, but is there much more to do before we get there?"</p>

evidently a prime favorite with the colored brethren. When the
service was over Dr. Emerson walked home behind two members of the
congregation, and overheard this conversation: "Massa George am a
mos' pow'ful preacher." "He am dat." "He's mos's pow'ful as Abraham
Lincoln." "Huh! He's mo' pow'ful dan Lincoln." "He's mos' 's
pow'ful as George Washin'ton." "Huh! He's mo' pow'ful dan

<p>Supper was in progress, and the father was telling about a row
which took place in front of his store that morning: "The first
thing I saw was one man deal the other a sounding blow, and then a
crowd gathered. The man who was struck ran and grabbed a large
shovel he had been using on the street, and rushed back, his eyes
blazing fiercely. I thought he'd surely knock the other man's
brains out, and I stepped right in between them."</p>
<p>The young son of the family had become so hugely interested in
the narrative as it proceeded that he had stopped eating his
pudding. So proud was he of his father's valor, his eyes fairly
shone, and he cried:</p>
<p>"He couldn't knock any brains out of you, could he, Father?"</p>
<p>Father looked at him long and earnestly, but the lad's
countenance was frank and open.</p>

<h3>CONSCIENCE</h3>
<p>The moral of this story may be that it is better to heed the
warnings of the "still small voice" before it is driven to the use
of the telephone.</p>
<p>A New York lawyer, gazing idly out of his window, saw a sight in
an office across the street that made him rub his eyes and look
again. Yes, there was no doubt about it. The pretty stenographer
was sitting upon the gentleman's lap. The lawyer noticed the name
that was lettered on the window and then searched in the telephone
book. Still keeping his eye upon the scene across the street, he
called the gentleman up. In a few moments he saw him start
violently and take down the receiver.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the lawyer through the telephone, "I should think
you would start."</p>
<p>The victim whisked his arm from its former position and began to
stammer something.</p>
<p>"Yes," continued the lawyer severely, "I think you'd better take
that arm away. And while you're about it, as long as there seems to
be plenty of chairs in the room&mdash;"</p>
<p>The victim brushed the lady from his lap, rather roughly, it is
to be feared. "Who&mdash;who the devil is this, anyhow?" he managed
to splutter.</p>

<h3>CONSIDERATION</h3>
<p>The goose had been carved at the Christmas dinner and everybody
had tasted it. It was excellent. The negro minister, who was the
guest of honor, could not restrain his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Dat's as fine a goose as I evah see, Bruddah Williams," he said
to his host. "Whar did you git such a fine goose?"</p>
<p>"Well, now, Pahson," replied the carver of the goose, exhibiting
great dignity and reticence, "when you preaches a speshul good
sermon I never axes you whar you got it. I hopes you will show me
de same considerashion."</p>

<p>A clergyman, who was summoned in haste by a woman who had been
taken suddenly ill, answered the call though somewhat puzzled by
it, for he knew that she was not of his parish, and was, moreover,
known to be a devoted worker in another church. While he was
waiting to be shown to the sick-room he fell to talking to the
little girl of the house.</p>
<p>"It is very gratifying to know that your mother thought of me in
her illness," said he, "Is your minister out of town?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," answered the child, in a matter-of-fact tone. "He's
home; only we thought it might be something contagious, and we
didn't want to take any risks."</p>

<h3>CONSTANCY</h3>
<p>A soldier belonging to a brigade in command of a General who
believed in a celibate army asked permission to marry, as he had
two good-conduct badges and money in the savings-bank.</p>
<p>"Well, go-away," said the General, "and if you come back to me a
year from today in the same frame of mind you shall marry. I'll
keep the vacancy."</p>
<p>On the anniversary the soldier repeated his request.</p>
<p>"But do you really, after a year, want to marry?" inquired the
General in a surprised tone.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; very much."</p>
<p>"Sergeant-Major, take his name down. Yes, you may marry. I never
believed there was so much constancy in man or woman. Right face;
quick march!"</p>
<p>As the man left the room, turning his head, he said, "Thank you,
sir; but it isn't the same woman."</p>

<p>A newly appointed Scotch minister on his first Sunday of office
had reason to complain of the poorness of the collection. "Mon,"
replied one of the elders, "they are close&mdash;vera close."</p>
<p>"But," confidentially, "the auld meenister he put three or four
saxpenses into the plate hissel', just to gie them a start. Of
course he took the saxpenses awa' with him afterward." The new
minister tried the same plan, but the next Sunday he again had to
report a dismal failure. The total collection was not only small,
but he was grieved to find that his own sixpences were missing. "Ye
may be a better preacher than the auld meenister," exclaimed the
elder, "but if ye had half the knowledge o' the world, an' o' yer

<p>"Fine corn," said Mr. Bacheller, tentatively, using a hillside

conversational ice.</p>
<p>"Best in Massachusetts," said the sitter.</p>
<p>"How do you plow that field?" asked Mr. Bacheller. "It is so

<p>"Don't plow it," said the sitter. "When the spring thaws come,
the rocks rolling down hill tear it up so that we can plant
corn."</p>
<p>"And how do you plant it?" asked Mr. Bacheller. The sitter said
that he didn't plant it, really. He stood in his back door and shot
the seed in with a shotgun.</p>

<h3>CURIOSITY</h3>
<p>The Christmas church services were proceeding very successfully
when a woman in the gallery got so interested that she leaned out
too far and fell over the railing. Her dress caught in a
chandelier, and she was suspended in mid-air. The minister noticed
her undignified position and thundered at the congregation:</p>
<p>"Any person in this congregation who turns around will be struck
stone-blind."</p>
<p>A man, whose curiosity was getting the better of him, but who
dreaded the clergyman's warning, finally turned to his companion
and said:</p>
<p>"I'm going to risk one eye."</p>

eying it in a how-did-it-happen sort of a way. The one-armed man
paid no attention to him but kept on eating with his one hand.
Finally the inquisitive one could stand it no longer. He changed
his position a little, cleared his throat, and said: "I beg pardon,
sir, but I see you have lost an arm."</p>
<p>The one-armed man picked up his sleeve with his right hand and
peered anxiously into it. "Bless my soul!" he exclaimed, looking up
with great surprise. "I do believe you're right."</p>

was derailed, and went bumping down a steep hill. The man evinced
signs of the greatest terror; and when the car came to a stop he
carefully examined himself to learn whether he had received any
injury. After ascertaining that he was unhurt, he thought of his
wife and damages.</p>

In due season the claim agent for the railroad called.</p>

claim-agentlemanly manner "and we sympathize with you and your
family in your loss. But, Mr. Olsen, you must remember this: Your
cow had no business being upon our tracks. Those tracks are our
private property and when she invaded them, she became a
trespasser. Technically speaking, you, as her owner, became a
trespasser also. But we have no desire to carry the issue into
court and possibly give you trouble. Now then, what would you
regard as a fair settlement between you and the railroad
company?"</p>

struggle to stand your ground at a Chicago literary luncheon. Your
right overshoe has a large block of Buffalo mud just under the
instep, the odor of a Utica cigar hangs about your clothing, and

<h3>DILEMMAS</h3>
<p>A story that has done service in political campaigns to
illustrate supposed dilemmas of the opposition will likely be
revived in every political "heated term."</p>
<p>Away back, when herds of buffalo grazed along the foothills of
the western mountains, two hardy prospectors fell in with a bull
bison that seemed to have been separated from his kind and run
amuck. One of the prospectors took to the branches of a tree and
the other dived into a cave. The buffalo bellowed at the entrance
to the cavern and then turned toward the tree. Out came the man
from the cave, and the buffalo took after him again. The man made
another dive for the hole. After this had been repeated several
times, the man in the tree called to his comrade, who was trembling
at the mouth of the cavern:</p>
<p>"Stay in the cave, you idiot!"</p>
<p>"You don't know nothing about this hole," bawled the other.
"There's a bear in it!"</p>

Cleveland administration in the capacity of consul of the Chinese

remarked:</p>

President the appointment of a consul unless he speaks the language
of the country to which he desires to go? Now, I suppose you do not
speak Chinese?"</p>

small boy with an anxious, forlorn look on his face and a
weedy-looking pup in his arms.</p>
<p>Goodwin inquired what was the matter, and was told that the boy
wished to sell the dog so as to raise the price of a seat in the
gallery. The actor suspected at once a dodge to secure a pass on
the "sympathy racket," but allowing himself to be taken in he gave
the boy a pass. The dog was deposited in a safe place and the boy
was able to watch Goodwin as the Gilded Fool from a good seat in
the gallery. Next day Goodwin saw the boy again near the theater,
so he asked:</p>

<p>Ex-congressman Asher G. Caruth, of Kentucky, tells this story of
an experience he once had on a visit to a little Ohio town.</p>
<p>"I went up there on legal business," he says, "and, knowing that
I should have to stay all night, I proceeded directly to the only
hotel. The landlord stood behind the desk and regarded me with a
kindly air as I registered. It seems that he was a little hard of
hearing, a fact of which I was not aware. As I jabbed the pen back
into the dish of bird shot, I said:</p>
<p>"'Can you direct me to the bank?'</p>
<p>"He looked at me blankly for a second, then swinging the
register around, he glanced down swiftly, caught the 'Louisville'
after my name, and an expression of complete understanding lighting
up his countenance, he said:</p>
<p>"'Certainly, sir. You will find the bar right through that door
at the left.'"</p>

<p>That clever and brilliant genius, McDougall, who represented
California in the United States Senate, was like many others of his
class somewhat addicted to fiery stimulants, and unable to battle
long with them without showing the effect of the struggle. Even in
his most exhausted condition he was, however, brilliant at
repartee; but one night, at a supper of journalists given to the
late George D. Prentice, a genius of the same mold and the same
unfortunate habit, he found a foeman worthy of his steel in General
John Cochrane. McDougall had taken offense at some anti-slavery
sentiments which had been uttered&mdash;it was in war
times&mdash;and late in the evening got on his legs for the tenth
time to make a reply. The spirit did not move him to utterance,
however; on the contrary, it quite deprived him of the power of
speech; and after an ineffectual attempt at speech he suddenly
concluded:</p>
<p>"Those are my sentiments, sir, and my name's McDougall."</p>
<p>"I beg the gentleman's pardon," said General Cochrane, springing
to his feet; "but what was that last remark?"</p>
<p>McDougall pronounced it again; "my name's McDougall."</p>
<p>"There must be some error," said Cochrane, gravely. "I have
known Mr. McDougall many years, and there never was a time when as
late as twelve o'clock at night he knew what his name was."</p>

<p>The city editor of a great New York daily was known in the
newspaper world as a martinet and severe disciplinarian. Some of
his caustic and biting criticisms are classics. Once, however, the
tables were turned upon him in a way that left him speechless for
days.</p>
<p>A reporter on the paper wrote an article that the city editor
did not approve of. The morning of publication this reporter
drifted into the office and encountered his chief, who was in a
white heat of anger. Carefully suppressing the explosion, however,
the boss started in with ominous and icy words:</p>
<p>"Mr. Blank, I am not going to criticize you for what you have
written. On the other hand, I am profoundly sorry for you. I have
watched your work recently, and it is my opinion, reached after
calm and dispassionate observation, that you are mentally
unbalanced. You are insane. Your mind is a wreck. Your friends
should take you in hand. The very kindest suggestion I can make is
that you visit an alienist and place yourself under treatment. So
far you have shown no sign of violence, but what the future holds
for you no one can tell. I say this in all kindness and frankness.
You are discharged."</p>
<p>The reporter walked out of the office and wandered up to
Bellevue Hospital. He visited the insane pavilion, and told the
resident surgeon that there was a suspicion that he was not all
right mentally and asked to be examined. The doctor put him through
the regular routine and then said,</p>
<p>"Right as a top."</p>
<p>"Sure?" asked the reporter. "Will you give me a certificate to
that effect?" The doctor said he would and did. Clutching the
certificate tightly in his hand the reporter entered the office an
hour later, walked up to the city editor, handed it to him
silently, and then blurted out,</p>
<p>"Now you go get one."</p>

<h3>EDUCATION</h3>

having more wealth than any one else in Colorado. A man of great
shrewdness and ability, he was exceedingly sensitive over his
inability to read or write. One day an old-timer met him with:</p>
<p>"How are you getting along, Pat?"</p>
<p>"Go 'way from me now," said Pat genially, "me head's bustin' wid
business. It takes two lid-pincils a day to do me wurruk."</p>

articles.</p>

<h3>EFFICIENCY</h3>
<p>An American motorist went to Germany in his car to the army
maneuvers. He was especially impressed with the German motor
ambulances. As the tourist watched the maneuvers from a seat under
a tree, the axle of one of the motor ambulances broke. Instantly
the man leaped out, ran into the village, returned in a jiffy with
a new axle, fixed it in place with wonderful skill, and
teuffed-teuffed off again almost as good as new.</p>
<p>"There's efficiency for you," said the American admirably.
"There's German efficiency for you. No matter what breaks, there's
always a stock at hand from which to supply the needed part."</p>
<p>And praising the remarkable instance of German efficiency he had
just witnessed, the tourist returned to the village and ordered up
his car. But he couldn't use it. The axle was missing.</p>

<p>James J. Hill, the Railway King, told the following amusing
incident that happened on one of his roads:</p>
<p>"One of our division superintendents had received numerous
complaints that freight trains were in the habit of stopping on a
grade crossing in a certain small town, thereby blocking travel for
long periods. He issued orders, but still the complaints came in.
Finally he decided to investigate personally.</p>
<p>"A short man in size and very excitable, he went down to the
crossing, and, sure enough, there stood, in defiance of his orders,
a long freight train, anchored squarely across it. A brakeman who
didn't know him by sight sat complacently on the top of the
car.</p>
<p>"'Move that train on!' sputtered the little 'super.' 'Get it off
the crossing so people can pass. Move on, I say!'</p>
<p>"The brakeman surveyed the tempestuous little man from head to
foot. 'You go to the deuce, you little shrimp,' he replied. 'You're
small enough to crawl under.'"</p>

<h3>ENEMIES</h3>
<p>An old man who had led a sinful life was dying, and his wife
sent for a near-by preacher to pray with him.</p>
<p>The preacher spent some time praying and talking, and finally
the old man said: "What do you want me to do, Parson?"</p>
<p>"Renounce the Devil, renounce the Devil," replied the
preacher.</p>
<p>"Well, but, Parson," protested the dying man, "I ain't in
position to make any enemies."</p>

give a coupon, and when you have smoked three thousand of them you
may bring the coupons to me and exchange them for a grand

<p>Nat sniffed the cigar, pinched it gently, and then replied: "If
I smoked three thousand of these cigars I think I would need a harp

<p>There was a burst of laughter in which the Englishman did not

<p>Theodore Watts, says Charles Rowley in his book "Fifty Years of
Work Without Wages," tells a good story against himself. A nature
enthusiast, he was climbing Snowdon, and overtook an old gypsy
woman. He began to dilate upon the sublimity of the scenery, in
somewhat gushing phrases. The woman paid no attention to him.
Provoked by her irresponsiveness, he said, "You don't seem to care
for this magnificent scenery?" She took the pipe from her mouth and
delivered this settler: "I enjies it; I don't jabber."</p>

<p>The widower had just taken his fourth wife and was showing her

and the bride paused before a very elaborate tombstone that had
been erected by the bridegroom. Being a little nearsighted she
asked him to read the inscription, and in reverent tones he
read:</p>
<p>"Here lies Susan, beloved wife of John Smith; also Jane, beloved
wife of John Smith; also Mary, beloved wife of John
Smith&mdash;"</p>
<p>He paused abruptly, and the bride, leaning forward to see the
bottom line, read, to her horror:</p>

large black hole in the ice, and a pale young fellow stood with
chattering teeth shoulder-deep in the cold water.</p>
<p>The farmer laid a board on the thin ice and crawled out on it to
the edge of the hole. Then, extending his hand, he said:</p>
<p>"Here, come over this way, and I'll lift you out."</p>
<p>"No, I can't swim," was the impatient reply. "Throw a rope to
me. Hurry up. It's cold in here."</p>

"What if you can't swim you can wade, I guess! The water's only up

<h3>EXAMINATIONS</h3>
<p>An instructor in a church school where much attention was paid
to sacred history, dwelt particularly on the phrase "And Enoch was
not, for God took him." So many times was this repeated in
connection with the death of Enoch that he thought even the dullest
pupil would answer correctly when asked in examination: State in
the exact language of the Bible what is said of Enoch's death.</p>

<p>"Enoch was not what God took him for."</p>

<p>Everybody knew that John Polkinhorn was the carelessest man in
town, but nobody ever thought he was careless enough to marry Susan
Rankin, seeing that he had known her for years. For awhile they got
along fairly well but one day after five years of it John hung
himself in the attic, where Susan used to dry the wash on rainy
days, and a carpenter, who went up to the roof to do some repairs,
found him there. He told Susan, and Susan hurried up to see about
it, and, sure enough, the carpenter was right. She stood looking at
her late husband for about a minute&mdash;kind of dazed, the
carpenter thought&mdash;then she spoke.</p>
<p>"Well, I declare!" she exclaimed. "If he hasn't used my new

<p>An Irish soldier was recently given leave of absence the morning
after pay day. When his leave expired he didn't appear. He was

engagement."</p>
<p>"Yes, sur."</p>
<p>"Have you any money left?"</p>
<p>"No, sur."</p>

<p>"Yes, sur."</p>
<p>"What did you do with it?"</p>
<p>"Well, sur, I was walking along and I met a friend, and we went
into a place and spint $8. Thin we came out and I met another
friend and we spint $8 more, and thin I come out and we met another
friend and we spint $8 more, and thin we come out and we met
another bunch of friends, and I spint $8 more&mdash;and thin I come
home."</p>
<p>"But, Murphy, that makes only $32. What did you do with the
other $3?" Murphy thought. Then he shook his head slowly and
said:</p>

here all the time, and, besides, you have your dolly. Now go to
sleep like a good little girl." Twenty minutes later a wail came
from upstairs, and mother went to the foot of the stairs to pacify
her daughter. "Don't cry," she said; "remember what I told
you&mdash;God is there with you and you have your dolly." "But I

Judge by his persistency finally got her to tell the story of the

<p>To modernize an old prophecy, "out of the mouths of babes shall
come much worldly wisdom." Mr. K. has two boys whom he dearly
loves. One day he gave each a dollar to spend. After much
bargaining, they brought home a wonderful four-wheeled steamboat
and a beautiful train of cars. For awhile the transportation
business flourished, and all was well, but one day Craig explained
to his father that while business had been good, he could do much
better if he only had the capital to buy a train of cars like
Joe's. His arguments must have been good, for the money was
forthcoming. Soon after, little Toe, with probably less logic but
more loving, became possessed of a dollar to buy a steamboat like
Craig's. But Mr. K., who had furnished the additional capital,
looked in vain for the improved service. The new rolling stock was
not in evidence, and explanations were vague and unsatisfactory, as
is often the case in the railroad game at which men play. It took a
stern court of inquiry to develop the fact that the railroad and
steamship had simply changed hands&mdash;and at a mutual profit of
one hundred per cent. And Mr. K., as he told his neighbor, said it
was worth that much to know that his boys would not need much of a
legacy from him.&mdash;<i>P.A. Kershaw</i>.</p>

greatly excited Pat, who called to his comrade to get up and come
to the window, but Mike was fast asleep. Another engine soon
followed the first, spouting smoke and fire like the former. This

<p>The London consul of a continental kingdom was informed by his
government that one of his countrywomen, supposed to be living in
Great Britain, had been left a large fortune. After advertising
without result, he applied to the police, and a smart young
detective was set to work. A few weeks later his chief asked how he
was getting on.</p>
<p>"I've found the lady, sir."</p>
<p>"Good! Where is she?"</p>
<p>"At my place. I married her yesterday."</p>

<p>JACK&mdash;"That's just the kind of a girl I could love. What's
her address?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Yes," said the old man to his young visitor, "I am proud of my
girls, and would like to see them comfortably married, and as I
have made a little money they will not go penniless to their
husbands. There is Mary, twenty-five years old, and a really good
girl. I shall give her $1,000 when she marries. Then comes Bet, who
won't see thirty-five again, and I shall give her $3,000, and the
man who takes Eliza, who is forty, will have $5,000 with her."</p>

<h3>FOURTH OF JULY</h3>
<p>"You are in favor of a safe and sane Fourth of July?"</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>One Fourth of July night in London, the Empire Music Hall
advertised special attractions to American visitors. All over the
auditorium the Union Jack and Stars and Stripes enfolded one
another, and at the interludes were heard "Yankee Doodle" and "Hail
Columbia," while a quartette sang "Down upon the Swanee River." It
was an occasion to swell the heart of an exiled patriot. Finally
came the turn of the Human Encyclopedia, who advanced to the front
of the stage and announced himself ready to answer, sight unseen,
all questions the audience might propound. A volley of queries was
fired at him, and the Encyclopedia breathlessly told the distance
of the earth from Mars, the number of bones in the human skeleton,
of square miles in the British Empire, and other equally important
facts. There was a brief pause, in which an American stood up.</p>
<p>"What great event took place July 4, 1776?" he propounded in a
loud glad voice.</p>
<p>The Human Encyclopedia glared at him. "Th' hincident you speak
of, sir, was a hinfamous houtrage!"</p>

<h3>FUTURE LIFE</h3>
<p>A certain young man's friends thought he was dead, but he was
only in a state of coma. When, in ample time to avoid being buried,
he showed signs of life, he was asked how it seemed to be dead.</p>
<p>"Dead?" he exclaimed. "I wasn't dead. I knew all that was going
on. And I knew I wasn't dead, too, because my feet were cold and I
was hungry."</p>
<p>"But how did that fact make you think you were still alive?"
asked one of the curious.</p>
<p>"Well, this way; I knew that if I were in heaven I wouldn't be
hungry. And if I was in the other place my feet wouldn't be

customary to place heavy shot with a body to insure its immediate
sinking, but in this instance, nothing else being available, a
large lump of coal was substituted. Mike's cup of sorrow overflowed
his eyes, and he tearfully exclaimed,</p>

<p>Mr. MacVeagh, in talking to the guest of the evening, said:
"Your Grace, among others you see here a great many railroad men.
There is a peculiarity of railroad men that even on social
occasions you will find that they always take their lawyer with
them. That is why I am here. They never go anywhere without their
counsel. Now they have nearly everything that men want, but I have
a suggestion to make to you for an exchange with us. We can give
free passes on all the railroads of the country. Now if you would
only give us&mdash;say a free pass to Paradise by way of
exchange."</p>

would never do. I would not like to separate them from their

very day mammy arrived. Before departing she had just time to
explain to mammy the modern conveniences with which her apartment
was furnished. The gas stove was the contrivance which interested
the colored woman most. After the mistress of the household had
lighted the oven, the broiler, and the other burners and felt
certain the old servant understood its operations, the mistress
hurried for her train.</p>
<p>She was absent for two weeks and one of her first questions to

his cup rapidly filled.</p>
<p>Nobody gave him more than a dime, however, except a grizzled
warrior of the lost cause, who plumped in a dollar. And not
content, he presently came that way again and plumped in another
dollar.</p>
<p>The cripple's gratitude did not quite extinguish his curiosity.
"Why," he inquired, "do you, who fought on the other side, give me
so much more than any of those who were my comrades in arms?"</p>
<p>The old rebel smiled grimly. "Because," he replied, "you're the

have to work at anything; and who has never been black-balled at
any of the clubs."</p>
<p>"A gentleman is (I take it) one born with the God-like capacity
to think and feel for others, irrespective of their rank or
condition.... One who possesses an ideal so lofty, a mind so
delicate, that it lifts him above all things ignoble and base, yet
strengthens his hands to raise those who are fallen&mdash;no matter

but one ghost story. Its hero was a man whom I may as well call
Snooks.</p>
<p>"Snooks, visiting at a country house, was put in the haunted
chamber for the night. He said that he did not feel the slightest
uneasiness, but nevertheless, just as a matter of precaution, he
took to bed with him a revolver of the latest American pattern.</p>
<p>"He slept peacefully enough until the clock struck two, when he
awoke with an unpleasant feeling of oppression. He raised his head
and peered about him. The room was wanly illumined by the full
moon, and in that weird, bluish light he thought he discerned a
small, white hand clasping the rail at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>"'Who's there?' he asked tremulously.</p>
<p>"There was no reply. The small white hand did not move.</p>
<p>"'Who's there?' he repeated. 'Answer me or I'll shoot.'</p>
<p>"Again there was no reply.</p>
<p>"Snooks cautiously raised himself, took careful aim and
fired.</p>

<p>Doctor William S. Rainsford is an inveterate golf player. When
he was rector of St. George's Church, in New York City, he was
badly beaten on the links by one of his vestrymen. To console the
clergyman the vestryman ventured to say: "Never mind, Doctor,
you'll get satisfaction some day when I pass away. Then you'll read
the burial service over me."</p>
<p>"I don't see any satisfaction in that," answered the clergy-man,
"for you'll still be in the hole."</p>

<p>The game of golf, as every humorist knows, is conducive to
profanity. It is also a terrible strain on veracity, every man
being his own umpire.</p>
<p>Four men were playing golf on a course where the hazard on the
ninth hole was a deep ravine.</p>
<p>They drove off. Three went into the ravine and one managed to
get his ball over. The three who had dropped into the ravine walked
up to have a look. Two of them decided not to try to play their
balls out and gave up the hole. The third said he would go down and
play out his ball. He disappeared into the deep crevasse. Presently
his ball came bobbing out and after a time he climbed up.</p>
<p>"How many strokes?" asked one of his opponents.</p>
<p>"Three."</p>
<p>"But I heard six."</p>
<p>"Three of them were echoes!"</p>

<p>When Mark Twain came to Washington to try to get a decent
copyright law passed, a representative took him out to Chevy
Chase.</p>
<p>Mark Twain refused to play golf himself, but he consented to
walk over the course and watch the representative's strokes. The
representative was rather a duffer. Teeing off, he sent clouds of
earth flying in all directions. Then, to hide his confusion he said
to his guest: "What do you think of our links here, Mr.
Clemens?"</p>
<p>"Best I ever tasted," said Mark Twain, as he wiped the dirt from
his lips with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>The seven-year-old daughter of a prominent suburban resident is,
the neighbors say, a precocious youngster; at all events, she knows
the ways of the world.</p>
<p>Her mother had occasion to punish her one day last week for a
particularly mischievous prank, and after she had talked it over
very solemnly sent the little girl up to her room.</p>
<p>An hour later the mother went upstairs. The child was sitting
complacently on the window seat, looking out at the other
children.</p>
<p>"Well, little girl," the mother began, "did you tell God all
about how naughty you'd been?"</p>
<p>The youngster shook her head, emphatically. "Guess I didn't,"
she gurgled; "why, it'd be all over heaven in no time."</p>

<p>The Democrats had a clear working majority in &mdash;&mdash;,
Illinois, for a number of years. But when the Fifteenth Amendment
went into effect it enfranchised so many of the "culled bredren" as
to make it apparent to the party leaders that unless a good many
black votes could be bought up, the Republicans would carry the
city election. Accordingly advances were made to the Rev. Brother
&mdash;&mdash;, whose influence it was thought desirable to secure,
inasmuch as he was certain to control the votes of his entire
church.</p>
<p>He was found "open to conviction," and arrangements progressed
satisfactorily until it was asked how much money would be necessary
to secure his vote and influence.</p>
<p>With an air of offended dignity, Brother &mdash;&mdash;
replied:</p>
<p>"Now, gemmen, as a regular awdained minister ob de Baptist
Church dis ting has gone jes as far as my conscience will 'low;

<p>A well-known New York contractor went into the tailor's, donned
his new suit, and left his old one for repairs. Then he sought a

pocket for the money to settle his check, he realized that he had
neglected to transfer both purse and watch when he left his suit.
As he hesitated, somewhat embarrassed, he saw a bill on the floor
at his feet. Seizing it thankfully, he stepped to the cashier's
desk and presented both check and money.</p>
<p>"That was a two dollar bill," he explained when he counted his
change.</p>

<h3>GREAT BRITAIN</h3>
<p>One of the stories told by Mr. Spencer Leigh Hughes in his
speech in the House of Commons one night tickled everybody. It is
the story of the small boy who was watching the Speaker's
procession as it wended its way through the lobby. First came the
Speaker, and then the chaplain, and next the other officers.</p>
<p>"Who, father, is that gentleman?" said the small boy, pointing
to the chaplain.</p>
<p>"That, my son," said the father, "is the chaplain of the
House."</p>
<p>"Does he pray for the members?" asked the small boy.</p>
<p>The father thought a minute and then said: "No, my son; when he
goes into the House he looks around and sees the members sitting
there and then he prays for the country."&mdash;<i>Cardiff
Mail</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There is a lad in Boston, the son of a well-known writer of
history, who has evidently profited by such observations as he may
have overheard his father utter touching certain phases of British
empire-building. At any rate the boy showed a shrewd notion of the
opinion not infrequently expressed in regard to the righteousness
of "British occupation." It was he who handed in the following
essay on the making of a British colony:</p>
<p>"Africa is a British colony. I will tell you how England does
it. First she gets a missionary; when the missionary has found a
specially beautiful and fertile tract of country, he gets all his
people round him and says: 'Let us pray,' and when all the eyes are
shut, up goes the British flag."</p>

manage him."</p>
<p>One morning, about a week after this conversation, Tommy
appeared at the first-grade teacher's door. She dropped her work,
seized him by the arm, dragged him to the dressing-room, turned him
over her knee and did her duty.</p>

<h3>HAPPINESS</h3>
<p>Lord Tankerville, in New York, said of the international school
question:</p>
<p>"The subject of the American versus the English school has been
too much discussed. The good got from a school depends, after all,
on the schoolboy chiefly, and I'm afraid the average schoolboy is
well reflected in that classic schoolboy letter home which
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'Dear parents&mdash;We are having a good time now at school.
George Jones broke his leg coasting and is in bed. We went skating
and the ice broke and all got wet. Willie Brown was drowned. Most
of the boys here are down with influenza. The gardener fell into
our cave and broke his rib, but he can work a little. The aviator

<h3>HARNESSING</h3>
<p>The story is told of two Trenton men who hired a horse and trap
for a little outing not long ago. Upon reaching their destination,
the horse was unharnessed and permitted peacefully to graze while
the men fished for an hour or two.</p>
<p>When they were ready to go home, a difficulty at once presented
itself, inasmuch as neither of the Trentonians knew how to
reharness the horse. Every effort in this direction met with dire
failure, and the worst problem was properly to adjust the bit. The
horse himself seemed to resent the idea of going into harness
again.</p>

road. "There's only one thing we can do, Bill," said he.</p>

He paused but an instant on the string-piece, and then, cheered on

stretch of water and landed safely on the deck. A fat man happened
to be standing on the exact spot on which he struck, and they both
went down with a resounding crash. When the arriving man had
somewhat recovered his breath he apologized to the fat man. "I hope

<p>Ex-District Attorney Jerome, at a dinner in New York, told a
story about honesty. "There was a man," he said, "who applied for a
position in a dry-goods house. His appearance wasn't prepossessing,
and references were demanded. After some hesitation, he gave the
name of a driver in the firm's employ. This driver, he thought,
would vouch for him. A clerk sought out the driver, and asked him
if the applicant was honest. 'Honest?' the driver said. 'Why, his
honesty's been proved again and again. To my certain knowledge he's
been arrested nine times for stealing and every time he was
acquitted.'"</p>

<p>A dumpy little woman with solemn eyes, holding by the hand two

a quarter, she asked meekly for the best seat she could get for
that money.</p>
<p>"Those boys must have tickets if you take them in," said the
clerk.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, mister," she said. "I never pay for them. I never can
spare more than a quarter, and I just love a show. We won't cheat
you any, mister, for they both go sound asleep just as soon as they
get into a seat, and don't see a single bit of it."</p>
<p>The argument convinced the ticket man, and he allowed the two
children to pass in.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the second act an usher came out of the

ticket-seller.</p>
<p>"What's this?" demanded the latter.</p>

<p>A city man, visiting a small country town, boarded a stage with
two dilapidated horses, and found that he had no other currency

<p>A traveler in Indiana noticed that a farmer was having trouble
with his horse. It would start, go slowly for a short distance, and
then stop again. Thereupon the farmer would have great difficulty
in getting it started. Finally the traveler approached and asked,
solicitously:</p>
<p>"Is your horse sick?"</p>
<p>"Not as I knows of."</p>
<p>"Is he balky?"</p>
<p>"No. But he is so danged 'fraid I'll say whoa and he won't hear

had given it to him: "Keep this horse for funerals?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed," answered the man indignantly.</p>

wouldn't get there in time for the resurrection."</p>

<h3>HOSPITALITY</h3>
<p>Night was approaching and it was raining hard. The traveler
dismounted from his horse and rapped at the door of the one
farmhouse he had struck in a five-mile stretch of traveling. No one
came to the door.</p>
<p>As he stood on the doorstep the water from the eaves trickled
down his collar. He rapped again. Still no answer. He could feel
the stream of water coursing down his back. Another spell of
pounding, and finally the red head of a lad of twelve was stuck out
of the second story window.</p>
<p>"Watcher want?" it asked.</p>
<p>"I want to know if I can stay here over night," the traveler
answered testily.</p>
<p>The red-headed lad watched the man for a minute or two before
answering.</p>
<p>"Ye kin fer all of me," he finally answered, and then closed the
window.</p>

protesting.</p>
<p>"Why, you know, Colonel," said he, "Louisville couldn't take
care of the crowds. Even by putting cots in the halls, parlors, and
the dining-rooms of the hotels there wouldn't be beds enough."</p>
<p>"Beds!" echoed the genial Congressman, "why, sir, Louisville
would make her visitors have such a thundering good time that no
gentleman would think of going to bed!"</p>

<p>The patient went off gayly to write his letter. He had it
finished and sealed, but when he was licking the stamp it slipped
through his fingers to the floor, lighted on the back of a
cockroach that was passing, and stuck. The patient hadn't seen the
cockroach&mdash;what he did see was his escaped postage stamp
zig-zagging aimlessly across the floor to the baseboard, wavering
up over the baseboard, and following a crooked track up the wall
and across the ceiling. In depressed silence he tore up the letter
he had just written and dropped the pieces on the floor.</p>
<p>"Two weeks! Hell!" he said. "I won't be out of here in three

<h3>IMAGINATION</h3>
<p>One day a mother overheard her daughter arguing with a little
boy about their respective ages.</p>
<p>"I am older than you," he said, "'cause my birthday comes first,
in May, and your's don't come till September."</p>
<p>"Of course your birthday comes first," she sneeringly retorted,
"but that is 'cause you came down first. I remember looking at the
angels when they were making you."</p>
<p>The mother instantly summoned her daughter. "It's breaking
mother's heart to hear you tell such awful stories," she said.
"Don't you remember what happened to Ananias and Sapphira?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, mamma, I know; they were struck dead for lying. I saw
them carried into the corner drug store!"</p>

<p>A lively looking porter stood on the rear platform of a

to be well taken care of. I pay for it. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never mind any 'buts.' You listen to what I say. Keep the train
boys away from me. Dust me off whenever I want you to. Give me an
extra blanket, and if there is any one in the berth over me slide
him into another. I want you to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Young man, when I'm giving instructions I prefer to do the
talking myself. You do as I say. Here is a two-dollar bill. I want
to get the good of it. Not a word, sir."</p>
<p>The train was starting. The porter pocketed the bill with a grin
and swung himself to the ground. "All right, boss!" he shouted.
"You can do the talking if you want to. I'm powerful sorry you
wouldn't let me tell you&mdash;but I ain't going out on that

<p>Jokes were first imported to this country several hundred years
ago from Egypt, Babylon and Assyria, and have since then grown and
multiplied. They are in extensive use in all parts of the country
and as an antidote for thought are indispensable at all dinner
parties.</p>
<p>There were originally twenty-five jokes, but when this country
was formed they added a constitution, which increased the number to
twenty-six. These jokes have married and inter-married among
themselves and their children travel from press to press.</p>
<p>Frequently in one week a joke will travel from New York to San
Francisco.</p>
<p>The joke is no respecter of persons. Shameless and unconcerned,
he tells the story of his life over and over again. Outside of the
ballot-box he is the greatest repeater that we have.</p>
<p>Jokes are of three kinds&mdash;plain, illustrated and pointless.
Frequently they are all three.</p>
<p>No joke is without honor, except in its own country. Jokes form
one of our staples and employ an army of workers who toil night and
day to turn out the often neatly finished product. The importation
of jokes while considerable is not as great as it might be, as the
flavor is lost in transit.</p>

<h3>JUDGES</h3>
<p>A judge once had a case in which the accused man understood only
Irish. An interpreter was accordingly sworn. The prisoner said
something to the interpreter.</p>
<p>"What does he say?" demanded his lordship.</p>
<p>"Nothing, my lord," was the reply.</p>
<p>"How dare you say that when we all heard him? Come on, sir, what
was it?"</p>
<p>"My lord," said the interpreter beginning to tremble, "it had
nothing to do with the case."</p>
<p>"If you don't answer I'll commit you, sir!" roared the judge.
"Now, what did he say?"</p>
<p>"Well, my lord, you'll excuse me, but he said, 'Who's that old
woman with the red bed curtain round her, sitting up there?"</p>
<p>At which the court roared.</p>
<p>"And what did you say?" asked the judge, looking a little
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"I said: 'Whist, ye spalpeen! That's the ould boy that's going
to hang you."</p>

<p>A gentleman of color who was brought before a police judge, on a
charge of stealing chickens, pleaded guilty. After sentencing him,
the judge asked how he had managed to steal the chickens when the

the yard.</p>
<p>"Hit wouldn't be of no use, Judge," answered the darky, "to try
to 'splain dis yer thing to yo' 't all. Ef yo' was to try it, like
as not yo' would get yer hide full o' shot, an' get no chicken,

<p>While the train was waiting on a side track down in Georgia, one
of the passengers walked over to a cabin near the track, in front
of which sat a cracker dog, howling. The passenger asked a native
why the dog was howling.</p>
<p>"Hookworm," said the native. "He's lazy."</p>
<p>"But," said the stranger, "I was not aware that the hookworm is
painful."</p>
<p>"'Taint," responded the garrulous native.</p>
<p>"Why, then," the stranger queried, "should the dog howl?"</p>
<p>"Lazy."</p>
<p>"But why does laziness make him howl?"</p>
<p>"Wal," said the Georgian, "that blame fool dawg is sittin' on a
sand-bur, an' he's too tarnation lazy to get off, so he jes' sets
thar an' howls 'cause it hurts."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"How's times?" inquired a tourist.</p>
<p>"Oh, pretty tolerable," responded the old native who was sitting
on a stump. "I had some trees to cut down, but a cyclone come along
and saved me the trouble."</p>
<p>"Fine."</p>
<p>"Yes, and then the lightning set fire to the brush pile and
saved me the trouble of burnin' it."</p>
<p>"Remarkable. But what are you going to do now?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothin' much. Jest waitin' for an earthquake to come along

<p>An Atlanta man tells of an amusing experience he had in a
mountainous region in a southwestern state, where the inhabitants
are notoriously shiftless. Arriving at a dilapidated shanty at the
noon hour, he inquired as to the prospects for getting dinner.</p>
<p>The head of the family, who had been "resting" on a fallen tree
in front of his dwelling, made reply to the effect that he "guessed
Ma'd hev suthin' on to the table putty soon."</p>
<p>With this encouragement, the traveler dismounted. To his
chagrin, however, he soon discovered that the food set before him
was such that he could not possibly "make a meal." He made such
excuses as he could for his lack of appetite, and finally bethought
himself of a kind of nourishment which he might venture to take,
and which was sure to be found in any locality. He asked for some
milk.</p>
<p>"Don't have milk no more," said the head of the place. "The
dawg's dead."</p>
<p>"The dog!" cried the stranger. "What on earth has the dog to do
with it?"</p>
<p>"Well," explained the host meditatively, "them cows don't seem

used to go for 'em an' fetch 'em up."&mdash;<i>Edwin

<p>"I don't remember having seen you here before," said she; "how
long have you been in the asylum?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I only came down yesterday," said the gentleman, "as one of
the Legislative Committee."</p>
<p>"Of course," returned the lady; "how stupid I am! However, I
knew you were an inmate or a member of the Legislature the moment I
looked at you. But how was I to know? It is so difficult to know

<h3>LIARS</h3>
<p>There are three kinds of liars:</p>
<p>1. The man whom others can't believe. He is harmless. Let him
alone.</p>
<p>2. The man who can't believe others. He has probably made a
careful study of human nature. If you don't put him in jail, he
will find out that you are a hypocrite.</p>
<p>3. The man who can't believe himself. He is a cautious
individual. Encourage him.</p>

a letter from your wife urging me not to let you come home because
you get drunk, break the furniture, and mistreat her

<p>An Idaho guide whose services were retained by some wealthy
young easterners desirous of hunting in the Northwest evidently
took them to be the greenest of tenderfoots, since he undertook to
chaff them with a recital something as follows:</p>
<p>"It was my first grizzly, so I was mighty proud to kill him in a
hand-to-hand struggle. We started to fight about sunrise. When he
finally gave up the ghost, the sun was going down."</p>
<p>At this point the guide paused to note the effect of his story.
Not a word was said by the easterners, so the guide added very
slowly, "<i>for the second time</i>."</p>
<p>"I gather, then," said one young gentleman, a dapper little
Bostonian, "that it required a period of two days to enable you to
dispose of that grizzly."</p>
<p>"Two days and a night," said the guide, with a grin. "That
grizzly died mighty hard."</p>
<p>"Choked to death?" asked the Bostonian.</p>
<p>"Yes, <i>sir</i>," said the guide.</p>

him to swallow?"</p>

<h3>MARRIAGE FEES</h3>
<p>A poor couple who went to the priest to be wedded were met with
a demand for the marriage fee. It was not forth-coming. Both the
consenting parties were rich in love and in their prospects, but
destitute of financial resources. The father was obdurate. "No
money, no marriage."</p>
<p>"Give me l'ave, your riverence," said the blushing bride, "to go
and get the money."</p>
<p>It was given, and she sped forth on the delicate mission of
raising a marriage fee out of pure nothing. After a short interval
she returned with the sum of money, and the ceremony was completed
to the satisfaction of all. When the parting was taking place the
newly-made wife seemed a little uneasy.</p>
<p>"Anything on your mind, Catherine?" said the father.</p>
<p>"Well, your riverence, I would like to know if this marriage
could not be spoiled now."</p>
<p>"Certainly not, Catherine. No man can put you asunder."</p>
<p>"Could you not do it yourself, father? Could you not spoil the
marriage?"</p>
<p>"No, no, Catherine. You are past me now. I have nothing more to
do with your marriage."</p>
<p>"That aises me mind," said Catherine, "and God bless your
riverence. There's the ticket for your hat. I picked it up in the
lobby and pawned it."</p>

The mule switched his tail, tossed his head and started on a mad

<h3>MILITARY DISCIPLINE</h3>
<p>Murphy was a new recruit in the cavalry. He could not ride at
all, and by ill luck was given one of the most vicious horses in
the troop.</p>
<p>"Remember," said the sergeant, "no one is allowed to dismount
without orders."</p>
<p>Murphy was no sooner in the saddle than he was thrown to the
ground.</p>
<p>"Murphy!" yelled the sergeant, when he discovered him lying
breathless on the ground, "you dismounted!"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"Did you have orders?"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"From headquarters, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"No, sor; from hintquarters."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"How dare you come on parade," exclaimed an Irish sergeant to a
recruit, "before a respictible man loike mysilf smothered from head
to foot in graise an' poipe clay? Tell me now&mdash;answer me when
I spake to yez!"</p>
<p>The recruit was about to excuse himself for his condition when
the sergeant stopped him.</p>
<p>"Dare yez to answer me when I puts a question to yez?" he cried.
"Hould yer lyin' tongue, and open your face at yer peril! Tell me
now, what have ye been doin' wid yer uniform an' arms an' bills?
Not a word, or I'll clap yez in the guardroom. When I axes yez
anything an' yez spakes I'll have yez tried for insolence to yer
superior officer, but if yez don't answer when I questions yez,
I'll have yez punished for disobedience of orders! So, yez see, I
have yez both ways!"</p>

<p>A Scottish woman, who was spending her holidays in London,
entered a bric-a-brac shop, in search of something odd to take home
to Scotland with her. After she had inspected several articles, but
had found none to suit her, she noticed a quaint figure, the head
and shoulders of which appeared above the counter.</p>
<p>"What is that Japanese idol over there worth?" she inquired of
the salesman.</p>

<p>"See here," he said, "this hat doesn't fit."</p>

<p>The steamer was on the point of leaving, and the passengers
lounged on the deck and waited for the start. At length one of them
espied a cyclist in the far distance, and it soon became evident
that he was doing his level best to catch the boat.</p>
<p>Already the sailors' hands were on the gangways, and the
cyclist's chance looked small indeed. Then a sportive passenger
wagered a sovereign to a shilling that he would miss it. The offer
was taken, and at once the deck became a scene of wild
excitement.</p>
<p>"He'll miss it."</p>
<p>"No; he'll just do it."</p>

<h3>MOTHERS</h3>
<p>While reconnoitering in Westmoreland County, Virginia, one of
General Washington's officers chanced upon a fine team of horses
driven before a plow by a burly slave. Finer animals he had never
seen. When his eyes had feasted on their beauty he cried to the
driver: "Hello good fellow! I must have those horses. They are just
such animals as I have been looking for."</p>
<p>The black man grinned, rolled up the whites of his eyes, put the
lash to the horses' flanks and turned up another furrow in the rich
soil.</p>
<p>The officer waited until he had finished the row; then throwing
back his cavalier cloak the ensign of the rank dazzled the slave's
eyes.</p>
<p>"Better see missus! Better see missus!" he cried waving his hand
to the south, where above the cedar growth rose the towers of a
fine old Virginia mansion.</p>
<p>The officer turned up the carriage road and soon was rapping the
great brass knocker of the front door.</p>
<p>Quickly the door swung upon its ponderous hinges and a grave,
majestic-looking woman confronted the visitor with an air of
inquiry.</p>
<p>"Madam," said the officer doffing his cap and overcome by her
dignity, "I have come to claim your horses in the name of the
Government."</p>
<p>"My horses?" said she, bending upon him a pair of eyes born to
command. "Sir, you cannot have them. My crops are out and I need my
horses in the field."</p>
<p>"I am sorry," said the officer, "but I must have them, madam.
Such are the orders of my chief."</p>
<p>"Your chief? Who is your chief, pray?" she demanded with
restrained warmth.</p>
<p>"The commander of the American army, General George Washington,"
replied the other, squaring his shoulders and swelling his
pride.</p>
<p>A smile of triumph softened the sternness of the woman's
features. "You go and tell General George Washington for me," said
she, "that his mother says he cannot have her horses."</p>

<p>The wagons of "the greatest show on earth" passed up the avenue
at daybreak. Their incessant rumbling soon awakened ten-year-old
Billie and five-year-old brother Robert. Their mother feigned sleep
as the two white-robed figures crept past her bed into the hall, on
the way to investigate. Robert struggled manfully with the
unaccustomed task of putting on his clothes. "Wait for me, Billie,"
his mother heard him beg. "You'll get ahead of me."</p>
<p>"Get mother to help you," counseled Billie, who was having
troubles of his own.</p>
<p>Mother started to the rescue, and then paused as she heard the
voice of her younger, guarded but anxious and insistent.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> ask her, Billie. You've known her longer than I

<p>A little girl, being punished by her mother flew, white with

paper and read:</p>

anxious to convert this man, and one day he went down in the
teamsters' part of the camp where the man was on duty. He talked
with him long and earnestly about religion and finally said:</p>

<p>"What color," he asked.</p>
<p>"Flesh cullah, suh."</p>
<p>Whereupon the clerk proffered a box of black court plaster.</p>
<p>The girl opened the box with a deliberation that was ominous,
but her face was unruffled as she noted the color of the contents
and said:</p>
<p>"I ast for flesh cullah, an' you done give me skin cullah." A
cart containing a number of negro field hands was being drawn by a
mule. The driver, a darky of about twenty, was endeavoring to
induce the mule to increase its speed, when suddenly the animal let
fly with its heels and dealt him such a kick on the head that he
was stretched on the ground in a twinkling. He lay rubbing his
woolly pate where the mule had kicked him.</p>
<p>"Is he hurt?" asked a stranger anxiously of an older negro who
had jumped from the conveyance and was standing over the prostrate
driver.</p>
<p>"No, Boss," was the older man's reply; "dat mule will probably

George received nearly all the colonel's cast-off clothing. He had

somewhat by rubbing grease on one knee. When the colonel saw the
spot, he called George and asked if he had noticed it. George said,
"Yes, sah, Colonel, I noticed dat spot and tried mighty hard to get
it out, but I couldn't."</p>
<p>"Have you tried gasoline?" the colonel asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, sah, Colonel, but it didn't do no good."</p>

<h3>NEW YORK CITY</h3>
<p>At a convention of Methodist Bishops held in Washington, the
Bishop of New York made a stirring address extolling the powers and
possibilities of his state. Bishop Hamilton, of California, like
all good Californians, is imbued with the conviction that it would
be hard to equal a place he knows of on the Pacific, and following
the Bishop of New York he gave a glowing picture of California,
concluding:</p>
<p>"Not only is it the best place on earth to live in, but it has
superior advantages, too, as a place to die in; for there we have
at our threshold the beautiful Golden Gate, while in New York they
only have&mdash;well, you know which gate it is over at New York!"
One night Dave Warfield was playing at David Belasco's new theatre,
supported by one of Mr. Belasco's new companies. The performance
ran with a smoothness of a Standard Oil lawyer explaining rebates
to a Federal court. A worthy person of the farming classes, sitting
in G 14, was plainly impressed. In an interval between the acts he
turned to the metropolitan who had the seat next him.</p>
<p>"Where do all them troopers come from?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"I don't think I understand," said the city-dweller.</p>
<p>"I mean them actors up yonder on the stage," explained the man
from afar. "Was they brought on specially for this show, or do they
live here?"</p>
<p>"I believe most of them live here in town," said the New
Yorker.</p>
<p>"Well, they do purty blamed well for home talent," said the
stranger.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A traveler in Tennessee came across an aged negro seated in
front of his cabin door basking in the sunshine.</p>
<p>"He could have walked right on the stage for an Uncle Tom part
without a line of makeup," says the traveler. "He must have been
eighty years of age."</p>
<p>"Good morning, uncle," says the stranger.</p>
<p>"Mornin', sah! Mornin'," said the aged one. Then he added, "Be
you the gentleman over yonder from New York?"</p>
<p>Being told that such was the case the old darky said; "Do you
mind telling me something that has been botherin' my old haid? I
have got a grandson&mdash;he runs on the Pullman cyars&mdash;and he
done tell me that up thar in New York you-all burn up youah folks
when they die. He is a poherful liar, and I don't believe him."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the other, "that is the truth in some cases. We
call it cremation."</p>
<p>"Well, you suttenly surprise me," said the negro and then he
paused as if in deep reflection. Finally he said: "You-all know I
am a Baptist. I believe in the resurrection and the life
everlastin' and the coming of the Angel Gabriel and the blowin' of
that great horn, and Lawdy me, how am they evah goin' to find them
folks on that great mawnin'?"</p>
<p>It was too great a task for an offhand answer, and the
suggestion was made that the aged one consult his minister. Again
the negro fell into a brown study, and then he raised his head and
his eyes twinkled merrily, and he said in a soft voice:</p>
<p>"Meanin' no offense, sah, but from what Ah have heard about New
York I kinder calcerlate they is a lot of them New York people that
doan' wanter be found on that mornin'."</p>

<p>Booth Tarkington says that in no state have the newspapers more

Mr. Tarkington lost one of his dogs.</p>
<p>"Have you a newspaper in town?" he asked of the landlord.</p>
<p>"Right across the way, there, back of the shoemaker's," the
landlord told him. "The <i>Daily News</i>&mdash;best little paper
of its size in the state."</p>
<p>The editor, the printer, and the printer's devil were all busy
doing justice to Mr. Tarkington with an "in-our-midst" paragraph
when the novelist arrived.</p>
<p>"I've just lost a dog," Tarkington explained after he had
introduced himself, "and I'd like to have you insert this ad for
me: 'Fifty dollars reward for the return of a pointer dog answering
to the name of Rex. Disappeared from the yard of the Mansion House

<h3>OBSERVATION</h3>
<p>In his daily half hour confidential talk with his boy an
ambitious father tried to give some good advice.</p>
<p>"Be observing, my son," said the father on one occasion.
"Cultivate the habit of seeing, and you will be a successful man.
Study things and remember them. Don't go through the world blindly.
Learn to use your eyes. Boys who are observing know a great deal
more than those who are not."</p>
<p>Willie listened in silence.</p>
<p>Several days later when the entire family, consisting of his
mother, aunt and uncle, were present, his father said:</p>
<p>"Well, Willie, have you kept using your eyes as I advised you to
do?"</p>
<p>Willie nodded, and after a moment's hesitation said:</p>
<p>"I've seen a few things right around the house. Uncle Jim's got
a bottle of hair dye hid under his trunk, Aunt Jennie's got an
extra set of teeth in her dresser, Ma's got some curls in her hat,
and Pa's got a deck of cards and a box of chips behind the books in

<h3>OFFICE-SEEKERS</h3>
<p>A gentleman, not at all wealthy, who had at one time represented
in Congress, through a couple of terms a district not far from the
national capitol, moved to California where in a year or so he rose
to be sufficiently prominent to become a congressional subject, and
he was visited by the central committee of his district to be
talked to.</p>
<p>"We want you," said the spokesman, "to accept the nomination for
Congress."</p>
<p>"I can't do it, gentlemen," he responded promptly.</p>
<p>"You must," the spokesman demanded.</p>
<p>"But I can't," he insisted. "I'm too poor."</p>
<p>"Oh, that will be all right; we've got plenty of money for the
campaign."</p>
<p>"But that is nothing," contended the gentleman; "it's the
expense in Washington. I've been there, and know all about it."</p>
<p>"Well you didn't lose by it, and it doesn't cost any more
because you come from California."</p>
<p>The gentleman became very earnest.</p>
<p>"Doesn't it?" he exclaimed in a business-like tone. "Why my dear
sirs, I used to have to send home every month about half a dozen
busted office-seeker constituents, and the fare was only $3 apiece,
and I could stand it, but it would cost me over $100 a head to send
them out here, and I'm no millionaire; therefore, as much as I
regret it, I must insist on declining."</p>

<p>"On a trip to Washington," said Col. W.F. Cody. "I had for a
companion Sousa, the band leader. We had berths opposite each
other. Early one morning as we approached the capital I thought I
would have a little fun. I got a morning paper, and, after rustling
it a few minutes, I said to Sousa:</p>
<p>"'That's the greatest order Cleveland has just issued!'</p>
<p>"'What's that?' came from the opposite berth.</p>
<p>"'Why he's ordered all the office-seekers rounded up at the
depot and sent home.'</p>
<p>"You should have seen the general consternation that ensued.
From almost every berth on the car a head came out from between the
curtains, and with one accord nearly every man shouted:</p>
<p>'What's that?'"</p>

you from the table and punish you soundly."</p>
<p>He experienced a feeling of profound satisfaction in being able
to thus reprove when it was necessary and glanced across the table
expecting to see a very demure little miss. Instead, Marion and her
little brother exchanged glances and then simultaneously a grin
overspread their faces, while Marion said in a mirthful tone:</p>

<p>General Gordon, the Confederate commander, used to tell the

when a dilapidated soldier, his clothing in rags, a shoe lacking,
his head bandaged, and his arm in a sling, passed him. He was
soliloquizing in this manner:</p>
<p>"I love my country. I'd fight for my country. I'd starve and go
thirsty for my country. I'd die for my country. But if ever this
damn war is over I'll never love another country!"</p>

<p>A snobbish young Englishman visiting Washington's home at Mount
Vernon was so patronizing as to arouse the wrath of guards and
caretakers; but it remained for "Shep" Wright, an aged gardener and
one of the first scouts of the Confederate army, to settle the
gentleman. Approaching "Shep," the Englishman said:</p>
<p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;my man, the hedge! Yes, I see, George got
this hedge from dear old England."</p>
<p>"Reckon he did," replied "Shep". "He got this whole blooming

<p>Speaking of the policy of the Government of the United States
with respect to its troublesome neighbors in Central and South
America, "Uncle Joe" Cannon told of a Missouri congressman who is
decidedly opposed to any interference in this regard by our
country. It seems that this spring the Missourian met an Englishman
at Washington with whom he conversed touching affairs in the
localities mentioned. The westerner asserted his usual views with
considerable forcefulness, winding up with this observation:</p>
<p>"The whole trouble is that we Americans need a &mdash;&mdash;
good licking!"</p>
<p>"You do, indeed!" promptly asserted the Britisher, as if pleased
by the admission. But his exultation was of brief duration, for the

less unpleasant than those to be found in the ordinary military
prison. Most of them appreciated their comparatively good fortune.
One young fellow, though, could not be reconciled to association
with Yankees under any circumstances, and took advantage of every
opportunity to express his feelings. He was continually rubbing it
in about the battle of Chickamauga, which had just been fought with
such disastrous results for the Union forces.</p>
<p>"Maybe we didn't eat you up at Chickamauga!" was the way he
generally greeted a bluecoat.</p>
<p>The Union men, when they could stand it no longer, reported the
matter to General Grant. Grant summoned the prisoner.</p>
<p>"See here," said Grant, "I understand that you are continually
insulting the men here with reference to the battle of Chickamauga.
They have borne with you long enough, and I'm going to give you
your choice of two things. You will either take the oath of
allegiance to the United States, or be sent to a Northern prison.
Choose."</p>
<p>The prisoner was silent for some time. "Well," he said at last,
in a resigned tone, "I reckon, General, I'll take the oath."</p>
<p>The oath was duly administered. Turning to Grant, the fellow
then asked, very penitently, if he might speak.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the general indifferently. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"Why, I was just thinkin', General," he drawled, "they certainly
did give us hell at Chickamauga."</p>

<p>Historical controversies are creeping into the schools. In a New
York public institution attended by many races, during an
examination in history the teacher asked a little chap who
discovered America.</p>
<p>He was evidently thrown into a panic and hesitated, much to the
teacher's surprise, to make any reply.</p>
<p>"Oh, please, ma'am," he finally stammered, "ask me somethin'
else."</p>
<p>"Something else, Jimmy? Why should I do that?"</p>
<p>"The fellers was talkin' 'bout it yesterday," replied Jimmy,
"Pat McGee said it was discovered by an Irish saint. Olaf, he said
it was a sailor from Norway, and Giovanni said it was Columbus, an'
if you'd a-seen what happened you wouldn't ask a little feller like
me."</p>

<h3>PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS</h3>
<p>The eight-year-old son of a Baltimore physician, together with a
friend, was playing in his father's office, during the absence of
the doctor, when suddenly the first lad threw open a closet door
and disclosed to the terrified gaze of his little friend an
articulated skeleton.</p>
<p>When the visitor had sufficiently recovered from his shock to
stand the announcement the doctor's son explained that his father
was extremely proud of that skeleton.</p>
<p>"Is he?" asked the other. "Why?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," was the answer; "maybe it was his first
patient."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The doctor stood by the bedside, and looked gravely down at the
sick man.</p>
<p>"I can not hide from you the fact that you are very ill," he
said. "Is there any one you would like to see?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the sufferer faintly.</p>

<p>An old darky once lay seriously ill of fever and was treated for
a long time by one doctor, and then another doctor, for some
reason, came and took the first one's place. The second physician
made a thorough examination of the patient. At the end he said,
"Did the other doctor take your temperature?"</p>
<p>"Ah dunno, sah," the patient answered. "Ah hain't missed nuthin'

<p>There had been an epidemic of colds in the town, and one
physician who had had scarcely any sleep for two days called upon a
patient&mdash;an Irishman&mdash;who was suffering from pneumonia,
and as he leaned over to hear the patient's respiration he called
upon Pat to count.</p>
<p>The doctor was so fatigued that he fell asleep, with his ear on
the sick man's chest. It seemed but a minute when he suddenly awoke
to hear Pat still counting: "Tin thousand an' sivinty-six, tin

others darted aimlessly about, crazed with terror and shouting for
mercy. The landlord of the hotel rushed out and seized me by the

<p>The Rev. Dr. Biddell tells a lively story about a Presbyterian
minister who had a young son, a lad about ten years of age. He was
endeavoring to bring him up in the way he should go, and was one
day asked by a friend what he intended to make of him. In reply he
said:</p>
<p>"I am watching the indications. I have a plan which I propose
trying with the boy. It is this: I am going to place in my parlor a
Bible, an apple and a silver dollar. Then I am going to leave the
room and call in the boy. I am going to watch him from some
convenient place without letting him know that he is seen. Then, if
he chooses the Bible, I shall make a preacher of him; if he takes
the apple, a farmer he shall be; but if he chooses the dollar, I
will make him a business man."</p>
<p>The plan was carried out. The arrangements were made and the boy
called in from his play. After a little while the preacher and his
wife softly entered the room. There was the youngster. He was
seated on the Bible, in one hand was the apple, from which he was
just taking a bite, and in the other he clasped the silver dollar.
The good man turned to his consort. "Wife," he said, "the boy is a

remarked upon their unpromising appearance and expressed pity for
anyone who had to dig a living out of such soil.</p>
<p>"I don't need no pity," said the boy resentfully.</p>
<p>The traveler hastened to soothe his wounded pride. But in the

<h3>PRAYERS</h3>
<p>During the winter the village preacher was taken sick, and
several of his children were also afflicted with the mumps. One day
a number of the devout church members called to pray for the
family. While they were about it a boy, the son of a member living
in the country, knocked at the preacher's door. He had his arms
full of things. "What have you there?" a deacon asked him.</p>
<p>"Pa's prayers for a happy Thanksgiving," the boy answered, as he
proceeded to unload potatoes, bacon, flour and other provisions for
the afflicted family.</p>

encountered on the road.</p>

<p>The new minister in a Georgia church was delivering his first
sermon. The darky janitor was a critical listener from a back
corner of the church. The minister's sermon was eloquent, and his
prayers seemed to cover the whole category of human wants.</p>
<p>After the services one of the deacons asked the old darky what
he thought of the new minister. "Don't you think he offers up a
good prayer, Joe?"</p>

<h3>PREACHING</h3>
<p>The services in the chapel of a certain western university are
from time to time conducted by eminent clergymen of many
denominations and from many cities.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when one of these visiting divines asked the
president how long he should speak, that witty officer replied:</p>
<p>"There is no limit, Doctor, upon the time you may preach; but I
may tell you that there is a tradition here that the most souls are
saved during the first twenty-five minutes."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>One Sunday morning a certain young pastor in his first charge
announced nervously:</p>
<p>"I will take for my text the words, 'And they fed five men with
five thousand loaves of bread and two thousand fishes.'"</p>
<p>At this misquotation an old parishioner from his seat in the
amen corner said audibly:</p>
<p>"That's no miracle&mdash;I could do it myself."</p>
<p>The young preacher said nothing at the time, but the next Sunday
he announced the same text again. This time he got it right:</p>
<p>"And they fed five thousand men on five loaves of bread and two
fishes."</p>
<p>He waited a moment, and then, leaning over the pulpit and
looking at the amen corner, he said:</p>
<p>"And could you do that, too, Mr. Smith?"</p>
<p>"Of course I could," Mr. Smith replied.</p>
<p>"And how would you do it?" said the preacher.</p>
<p>"With what was left over from last Sunday," said Mr. Smith.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The late Bishop Foss once visited a Philadelphia physician for
some trifling ailment. "Do you, sir," the doctor asked, in the
course of his examination, "talk in your sleep?"</p>
<p>"No sir," answered the bishop. "I talk in other people's. Aren't
you aware that I am a divine?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Yes, sir," said the irate man, "I got even with that clergyman.
I slurred him. Why, I hired one hundred people to attend his church
and go to sleep before he had preached five minutes."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A noted eastern Judge when visiting in the west went to church
on Sunday; which isn't so remarkable as the fact that he knew
beforehand that the preacher was exceedingly tedious and long
winded to the last degree. After the service the preacher met the
Judge in the vestibule and said: "Well, your Honor, how did you
like the sermon?"</p>
<p>"Oh, most wonderfully," replied the Judge. "It was like the
peace of God; for it passed all understanding, and, like His mercy,
I thought it would have endured forever."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The preacher's evening discourse was dry and long, and the
congregation gradually melted away. The sexton tiptoed up to the
pulpit and slipped a note under one corner of the Bible. It
read:</p>
<p>"When you are through, will you please turn off the lights, lock
the door, and put the key under the mat?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The new minister's first sermon was very touching and created
much favorable comment among the members of the church. One
morning, a few days later, his nine-year-old son happened to be
alone in the pastor's study and with childish curiosity started to
read through some papers on the desk. They happened to be this
identical sermon, but he was most interested in the marginal notes.
In one place in the margin were written the words, "Cry a little."
Further on in the discourse appeared another marginal remark, "Cry
a little more." On the next to the last sheet the boy found his
good father had penned another remark, "Cry like thunder."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A young preacher, who was staying at a clergy-house, was in the
habit of retiring to his room for an hour or more each day to
practice pulpit oratory. At such times he filled the house with
sounds of fervor and pathos, and emptied it of almost everything
else. Phillips Brooks chanced to be visiting a friend in this house
one day when the budding orator was holding forth.</p>
<p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed the Bishop, starting up in assumed
terror, "pray, what might that be?"</p>
<p>"Sit down, Bishop," his friend replied. "That's only young
D&mdash;&mdash; practising what he preaches."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A distinguished theologian was invited to make an address before
a Sunday-school. The divine spoke for over an hour and his remarks
were of too deep a character for the average juvenile mind to
comprehend. At the conclusion, the superintendent, according to
custom, requested some one in the school to name an appropriate
hymn to be sung.</p>
<p>"Sing 'Revive Us Again,'" shouted a boy in the rear of the
room.</p>

<p>A clergyman was once sent for in the middle of the night by one
of his woman parishioners.</p>
<p>"Well, my good woman," said he, "so you are ill and require the
consolations of religion? What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"No," replied the old lady, "I am only nervous and can't
sleep!"</p>
<p>"But how can I help that?" said the parson.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, you always put me to sleep so nicely when I go to
church that I thought if you would only preach a little for
me!"</p>

<p>A stranger entered the church in the middle of the sermon and
seated himself in the back pew. After a while he began to fidget.

<p>"I'll stay then," decided the stranger. "He must be nearly
done."</p>

upon departing, said: "Just let your husband take that and you'll

her face beaming with smiles. "Sure, that was a wonderful wee bit
of paper you left yesterday," she exclaimed. "William is better
to-day."</p>
<p>"I'm glad to hear that," said the much-pleased medical man.</p>
<p>"Not but what I hadn't a big job to get him to swallow it." she
continued, "but, sure, I just wrapped up the wee bit of paper quite
small and put it in a spoonful of jam and William swallowed it

particular day, considered himself insulted when the prisoner
looking around the cell told him it was dirty, and not fit for a
hog to be put in. One word brought on another, till finally the
jailer told the prisoner if he did not behave himself he would put
him out. To which the prisoner replied: "I will give you to

he was saying. On one occasion, in the course of an eloquent
prayer, he pleaded:</p>
<p>"O Lord! waken thy cause in the hearts of this congregation and
give them new eyes to see and new impulse to do. Send down Thy

<p>A gentleman who had been in Chicago only three days, but who had
been paying attention to a prominent Chicago belle, wanted to
propose, but was afraid he would be thought too hasty. He
delicately broached the subject as follows: "If I were to speak to
you of marriage, after having only made your acquaintance three
days ago, what would you say of it?"</p>
<p>"Well, I should say, never put off till tomorrow that which
should have been done the day before yesterday."</p>

<p>The four Gerton girls were all good-looking; indeed, the three
younger ones were beautiful; while Annie, the oldest, easily made
up in capability and horse sense what she lacked in looks.</p>
<p>A young chap, very eligible, called on the girls frequently, but
seemed unable to decide which to marry. So Annie put on her
thinking cap, and, one evening when the young chap called, she
appeared with her pretty arms bare to the elbow and her hands white
with flour.</p>
<p>"Oh, you must excuse my appearance," she said. "I have been
working in the kitchen all day. I baked bread and pies and cake
this morning, and afterward, as the cook was ill, I prepared
dinner."</p>

<h3>PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH</h3>
<p>One of our popular New England lecturers tells this amusing
story.</p>
<p>A street boy of diminutive stature was trying to sell some very
young kittens to passers-by. One day he accosted the late Reverend
Phillips Brooks, asking him to purchase, and recommending them as
good Episcopal kittens. Dr. Brooks laughingly refused, thinking
them too small to be taken from their mother. A few days later a
Presbyterian minister who had witnessed this episode was asked by
the same boy to buy the same kittens. This time the lad announced
that they were faithful Presbyterians.</p>
<p>"Didn't you tell Dr. Brooks last week that they were Episcopal
kittens?" the minister asked sternly.</p>
<p>"Yes sir," replied the boy quickly, "but they's had their eyes
opened since then, sir."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An Episcopal clergyman who was passing his vacation in a remote
country district met an old farmer who declared that he was a
"'Piscopal."</p>
<p>"To what parish do you belong?" asked the clergyman.</p>
<p>"Don't know nawthin' 'bout enny parish," was the answer.</p>
<p>"Who confirmed you, then?" was the next question.</p>
<p>"Nobody," answered the farmer.</p>
<p>"Then how are you an Episcopalian?" asked the clergyman.</p>
<p>"Well," was the reply, "you see it's this way: Last winter I
went to church, an' it was called 'Piscopal, an' I heerd them say
that they left undone the things what they'd oughter done and
they'd done some things what they oughtenter done, and I says to
myself says I: 'That's my fix exac'ly,' and ever sence then I've

<p>There's a certain minister whose duties sometimes call him out
of the city. He has always arranged for some one of his
parishioners to keep company with his wife and little daughter
during these absences. Recently, however, he was called away so
suddenly that he had no opportunity of providing a guardian.</p>
<p>The wife was very brave during the early evening, but after dark
had fallen her courage began to fail. She stayed up with her little
girl till there was no excuse for staying any longer and then took
her upstairs to bed.</p>
<p>"Now go to sleep, Dearie," she said. "Don't be afraid. God will
protect you."</p>

<h3>PROVINCIALISM</h3>
<p>Some time ago an English friend of Colonel W.J. Lampton's living
in New York and having never visited the South, went to Virginia to
spend a month with friends. After a fortnight of it, he wrote
back:</p>
<p>"Oh, I say, old top, you never told me that the South was
anything like I have found it, and so different to the North. Why,
man, it's God's country."</p>
<p>The Colonel, who gets his title from Kentucky, answered promptly
by postal.</p>
<p>"Of course it is," he wrote. "You didn't suppose God was a
Yankee, did you?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A southerner, with the intense love for his own district,
attended a banquet. The next day a friend asked him who was
present. With a reminiscent smile he replied: "An elegant gentleman
from Virginia, a gentleman from Kentucky, a man from Ohio, a
bounder from Chicago, a fellow from New York, and a galoot from
Maine."</p>
<p>They had driven fourteen miles to the lake, and then rowed six
miles across the lake to get to the railroad station, when the
Chicago man asked:</p>
<p>"How in the world do you get your mail and newspapers here in
the winter when the storms are on?"</p>
<p>"Wa-al, we don't sometimes. I've seen this lake thick up so that
it was three weeks before we got a Chicago paper," answered the man
from "nowhere."</p>
<p>"Well, you were cut off," said the Chicago man.</p>
<p>"Ya-as, we were so," was the reply. "Still, the Chicago folks
were just as badly off."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"Wa-al," drawled the man, "we didn't know what was going on in
Chicago, of course. But then, neither did Chicago folks know what
was going on down here."</p>

celebrated oculist. "Every time he went to read he would read

<p>Ex-senator Spooner of Wisconsin says the best speech of

<p>A South African tribe has an effective method of dealing with
bores, which might be adopted by Western peoples. This simple tribe
considers long speeches injurious to the orator and his hearers; so
to protect both there is an unwritten law that every public orator
must stand on only one leg when he is addressing an audience. As
soon as he has to place the other leg on the ground his oration is
brought to a close, by main force, if necessary.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A rather turgid orator, noted for his verbosity and heaviness,
was once assigned to do some campaigning in a mining camp in the
mountains. There were about fifty miners present when he began; but
when, at the end of a couple of hours, he gave no sign of
finishing, his listeners dropped away.</p>
<p>Some went back to work, but the majority sought places to quench
their thirst, which had been aggravated by the dryness of the
discourse.</p>
<p>Finally there was only one auditor left, a dilapidated,
weary-looking old fellow. Fixing his gaze on him, the orator pulled
out a large six-shooter and laid it on the table. The old fellow
rose slowly and drawled out:</p>
<p>"Be you going to shoot if I go?"</p>
<p>"You bet I am," replied the speaker. "I'm bound to finish my
speech, even if I have to shoot to keep an audience."</p>
<p>The old fellow sighed in a tired manner, and edged slowly away,
saying as he did so:</p>
<p>"Well, shoot if you want to. I may jest as well be shot as
talked to death."</p>

<p>The self-made millionaire who had endowed the school had been
invited to make the opening speech at the commencement exercises.
He had not often had a chance of speaking before the public and he
was resolved to make the most of it. He dragged his address out
most tiresomely, repeating the same thought over and over. Unable
to stand it any longer a couple of boys in the rear of the room
slipped out. A coachman who was waiting outside asked them if the
millionaire had finished his speech.</p>
<p>"Gee, yes!" replied the boys, "but he won't stop."</p>

<p>Mark Twain once told this story:</p>
<p>"Some years ago in Hartford, we all went to church one hot,
sweltering night to hear the annual report of Mr. Hawley, a city
missionary who went around finding people who needed help and
didn't want to ask for it. He told of the life in cellars, where
poverty resided; he gave instances of the heroism and devotion of
the poor. When a man with millions gives, he said, we make a great
deal of noise. It's a noise in the wrong place, for it's the
widow's mite that counts. Well, Hawley worked me up to a great
pitch. I could hardly wait for him to get through. I had $400 in my
pocket. I wanted to give that and borrow more to give. You could
see greenbacks in every eye. But instead of passing the plate then,
he kept on talking and talking and talking, and as he talked it
grew hotter and hotter and hotter, and we grew sleepier and
sleepier and sleepier. My enthusiasm went down, down, down,
down&mdash;$100 at a clip&mdash;until finally, when the plate did
come around, I stole ten cents out of it. It all goes to show how a
little thing like this can lead to crime."</p>

arm is not himself, and I fail to see how you can punish the whole
individual for an offense committed by only one of his limbs."</p>

logically, I sentence the defendant's arm to one year's
imprisonment. He can accompany it or not, as he chooses."</p>

<h3>PURE FOOD</h3>
<p>Into a general store of a town in Arkansas there recently came a
darky complaining that a ham which he had purchased there was not
good.</p>
<p>"The ham is all right, Zeph," insisted the storekeeper.</p>
<p>"No, it ain't, boss," insisted the negro. "Dat ham's shore
bad."</p>
<p>"How can that be," continued the storekeeper, "when it was cured
only a week?"</p>
<p>The darky scratched his head reflectively, and finally
suggested: "Den, mebbe it's had a relapse."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>On a recent trip to Germany, Doctor Harvey Wiley, the pure-food
expert, heard an allegory with reference to the subject of food
adulteration which, he contends, should cause Americans to
congratulate themselves that things are so well ordered in this
respect in the United States.</p>
<p>The German allegory was substantially as follows:</p>
<p>Four flies, which had made their way into a certain pantry,
determined to have a feast.</p>
<p>One flew to the sugar and ate heartily; but soon died, for the
sugar was full of white lead.</p>
<p>The second chose the flour as his diet, but he fared no better,
for the flour was loaded with plaster of Paris.</p>
<p>The third sampled the syrup, but his six legs were presently
raised in the air, for the syrup was colored with aniline dyes.</p>
<p>The fourth fly, seeing all his friends dead, determined to end
his life also, and drank deeply of the fly-poison which he found in
a convenient saucer.</p>
<p>He is still alive and in good health. That, too, was
adulterated.</p>

master an' the missus used to quarrel, mum."</p>
<p>"Dear me! Do you mean to say that they actually used to
quarrel?"</p>
<p>"Yis, mum, all the time. When it wasn't me an' him, it was me
an' her."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"I hear ye had words with Casey."</p>
<p>"We had no words."</p>
<p>"Then nothing passed between ye?"</p>
<p>"Nothing but one brick."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There had been a wordy falling-out between Mrs. Halloran and
Mrs. Donohue; there had been words; nay, more, there had been
language. Mrs. Halloran had gone to church early in the morning,
had fulfilled the duties of her religion, and was returning primly
home, when Mrs. Donohue spied her, and, still smouldering with
volcanic fire, sent a broadside of lava at Mrs. Halloran. The
latter heard, flushed, opened her lips&mdash;and then suddenly
checked herself. After a moment she spoke: "Mrs. Donohue, I've just
been to church, and I'm in a state of grace. But, plaze Hivin, the
next time I meet yez, I won't be, and thin I'll till yez what I
think of yez!"</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
<p>The more questions a woman asks the fewer answers she
remembers.&mdash;<i>Wasp</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It was a very hot day and the fat drummer who wanted the
twelve-twenty train got through the gate at just twelve-twenty-one.
The ensuing handicap was watched with absorbed interest both from
the train and the station platform. At its conclusion the
breathless and perspiring knight of the road wearily took the back
trail, and a vacant-faced "red-cap" came out to relieve him of his
grip.</p>
<p>"Mister," he inquired, "was you tryin' to ketch that
Pennsylvania train?"</p>
<p>"No, my son," replied the patient man. "No; I was merely chasing
it out of the yard."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A party of young men were camping, and to avert annoying
questions they made it a rule that the one who asked a question
that he could not answer himself had to do the cooking.</p>
<p>One evening, while sitting around the fire, one of the boys
asked: "Why is it that a ground-squirrel never leaves any dirt at
the mouth of its burrow?"</p>
<p>They all guessed and missed. So he was asked to answer it
himself.</p>
<p>"Why," he said, "because it always begins to dig at the other
end of the hole."</p>
<p>"But," one asked, "how does it get to the other end of the
hole?"</p>
<p>"Well," was the reply, "that's your question."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A browbeating lawyer was demanding that a witness answer a
certain question either in the negative or affirmative.</p>
<p>"I cannot do it," said the witness. "There are some questions
that cannot be answered by a 'yes' or a 'no,' as any one
knows."</p>
<p>"I defy you to give an example to the court," thundered the
lawyer.</p>
<p>The retort came like a flash: "Are you still beating your
wife?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Officers have a right to ask questions in the performance of
their duty, but there are occasions when it seems as if they might
curtail or forego the privilege. Not long ago an Irishman whose
hand had been badly mangled in an accident entered the Boston City
Hospital relief station in a great hurry. He stepped up to the man
in charge and inquired:</p>
<p>"Is this the relief station, sor?"</p>
<p>"Yes. What is your name?"</p>
<p>"Patrick O'Connor, sor."</p>
<p>"Are you married?" questioned the officer.</p>
<p>"Yis, sor, but is this the relief station?" He was nursing his
hand in agony.</p>
<p>"Of course it is. How many children have you?"</p>
<p>"Eight, sor. But sure, this is the relief station?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is," replied the officer, a little angry at the man's
persistence.</p>
<p>"Well," said Patrick, "sure, an' I was beginning to think that
it might be the pumping station."</p>

<h3>RACE PRIDE</h3>
<p>Sam Jones, the evangelist, was leading a revival meeting in
Huntsville, Texas, a number of years ago, and at the close of one
of the services an old negro woman pushed her way up through the
crowd to the edge of the pulpit platform. Sam took the perspiring
black hand that was held out to him, and heard the old woman say:
"Brudder Jones, you sho' is a finepreacher! Yes, suh; de Lord bless
you. You's des everybody's preacher. You's de white folks'
preacher, and de niggers' preacher, and everybody's preacher.

<p>"Dan O'Connell," said Pat and took another.</p>
<p>"Abraham," said Ikey, helping himself again.</p>

whiskers.</p>
<p>Pat emitted a roar of pain, grasped the Jew's beard with both

down his pick and started up the track ahead of the train as fast
as he could run. The train overtook him and tossed him into a
ditch. Badly shaken up he was taken to the hospital, where the

<p>On one of the southern railroads there is a station-building
that is commonly known by travelers as the smallest railroad
station in America. It is of this station that the story is told
that an old farmer was expecting a chicken-house to arrive there,
and he sent one of his hands, a new-comer, to fetch it. Arriving
there the man saw the house, loaded it on to his wagon and started
for home. On the way he met a man in uniform with the words
"Station Agent" on his cap.</p>
<p>"Say, hold on. What have you got on that wagon?" he asked.</p>
<p>"My chicken-house, of course," was the reply.</p>
<p>"Chicken-house be jiggered!" exploded the official. "That's

<p>"Nothing like it. The poor fellow starved to death waiting for

<hr class="short" />
<p>The reporter who had accompanied the special train to the scene
of the wreck, hurried down the embankment and found a man who had
one arm in a sling, a bandage over one eye, his front teeth gone,
and his nose knocked four points to starboard, sitting on a piece
of the locomotive and surveying the horrible ruin all about
him.</p>
<p>"Can you give me some particulars of this accident?" asked the
reporter, taking out his notebook.</p>
<p>"I haven't heard of any accident, young man," replied the
disfigured party stiffly.</p>
<p>He was one of the directors of the railroad.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Hon. John Sharp Williams had an engagement to speak in a
small southern town. The train he was traveling on was not of the
swiftest, and he lost no opportunity of keeping the conductor
informed as to his opinions of that particular road.</p>
<p>"Well, if yer don't like it," the conductor finally blurted out,
"why in thunder don't yer git out an' walk?"</p>
<p>"I would," Mr. Williams blandly replied, "but you see the
committee doesn't expect me until this train gets in."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"We were bounding along," said a recent traveler on a local
South African single-line railway, "at the rate of about seven
miles an hour, and the whole train was shaking terribly. I expected
every moment to see my bones protruding through my skin. Passengers
were rolling from oneend of the car to the other. I held on firmly
to the arms of the seat. Presently we settled down a bit quieter;
at least, I could keep my hat on, and my teeth didn't
chatter."There was a quiet looking man opposite me. I looked up
with a ghastly smile, wishing to appear cheerful, and said:</p>
<p>"'We are going a bit smoother, I see.'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' he said, 'we're off the track now.'"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Three men were talking in rather a large way as to the excellent
train service each had in his special locality: one was from the
west, one from New England, and the other from New York. The former
two had told of marvelous doings of trains, and it is distinctly
"up" to the man from New York.</p>
<p>"Now in New York," he said, "we not only run our trains fast,
but we also start them fast. I remember the case of a friend of
mine whose wife went to see him off for the west on the
Pennsylvania at Jersey City. As the train was about to start my
friend said his final good-by to his wife, and leaned down from the
car platform to kiss her. The train started, and, would you believe
it, my friend found himself kissing a strange woman on the platform
at Trenton!"</p>
<p>And the other men gave it up.</p>

<p>"Say, young man," asked an old lady at the ticket-office, "what

<p>An express on the Long Island Railroad was tearing away at a
wild and awe-inspiring rate of six miles an hour, when all of a
sudden it stopped altogether. Most of the passengers did not notice
the difference; but one of them happened to be somewhat anxious to
reach his destination before old age claimed him for its own. He
put his head through the window to find that the cause of the stop
was a cow on the track. After a while they continued the journey
for half an hour or so, and then&mdash;another stop.</p>
<p>"What's wrong now?" asked the impatient passenger of the
conductor.</p>
<p>"A cow on the track."</p>
<p>"But I thought you drove it off."</p>
<p>"So we did," said the conductor, "but we caught up with it
again."</p>

<p>The president of one great southern railway pulled into a
southern city in his private car. It was also the terminal of a
competing road, and the private car of the president of the other
line was on a side track. There was great rivalry between these two
lines, which extended from the president of each down to the most
humble employe. In the evening the colored cook from one of the
cars wandered over to pass the time of day with the cook on the
other car.</p>
<p>One of these roads had recently had an appalling list of
accidents, and the death-toll was exceptionally high. The cook from
this road sauntered up to the back platform of the private car, and
after an interchange of courtesies said:</p>
<p>"Well, how am youh ole jerkwatah railroad these days? Am you
habbing prosper's times?"</p>
<p>"Man," said the other, "we-all am so prosperous that if we was
any moah prosperous we just naturally couldn't stand hit."</p>

you-all."</p>
<p>"Man," said the other, "we dun carry moah'n a million passengers

pressed her lips tightly together. At last she got up, with a weary

<p>When Bishop Phillips Brooks sailed from America on his last trip

discover some new religion to bring home with him. "But be careful
of it, Bishop Brooks," remarked a listening friend; "it may be
difficult to get your new religion through the Custom House."</p>
<p>"I guess not," replied the Bishop, laughingly, "for we may take
it for granted that any new religion popular enough to import will
have no duties attached to it."</p>

<p>A recent book on Russia relates the story of the anger of the
Apostle John because a certain peasant burned no tapers to his
ikon, but honored, instead, the ikon of Apostle Peter in St. John's
own church. The two apostles talked it over as they walked the
fields near Kieff, and Apostle John decided to send a terrible
storm to destroy the just ripe corn of the peasant. His decision
was carried out, and the next day he met Apostle Peter and boasted
of his punishing wrath.</p>
<p>And Apostle Peter only laughed. "Ai, yi, yi, Apostle John," he
said, "what a mess you've made of it. I stepped around, saw my
friend, and told him what you were going to do, so he sold his corn
to the priest of your church."</p>

<p>The friendship existing between Father Kelly and Rabbi Levi is
proof against differences in race and religion. Each distinguished
for his learning, his eloquence and his wit; and they delight in
chaffing each other. They were seated opposite each other at a

made comments upon its flavor. Presently he leaned forward and in a

rid of her any way you can. Tell her I am asleep, or anything you

<p>An Episcopal clergyman, rector of a fashionable church in one of
Boston's most exclusive suburbs, so as not to be bothered with the
innumerable telephone calls that fall to one in his profession, had
his name left out of the telephone book. A prominent merchant of

by requests to officiate at funerals and baptisms. He went to the
rector, told his troubles in a kindly way, and asked the parson to
have his name put in the directory. But without success.</p>
<p>The merchant then determined to complain to the telephone
company. As he was writing the letter, one Saturday evening, the
telephone rang and the timid voice of a young man asked if the Rev.
Mr. Blank would marry him at once. A happy thought came to the
merchant: "No, I'm too damn busy writing my sermon," he

coat and collar off, mopping his brow.</p>
<p>"Ah, gentlemen," he said, "dee-lighted to see you. Dee-lighted.
But I'm very busy putting in my hay just now. Come down to the barn
with me and we'll talk things over while I work."</p>
<p>Down to the barn hustled President and delegation.</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt seized a pitchfork and&mdash;but where was the
hay?</p>
<p>"John!" shouted the President. "John! where's all the hay?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir," came John's voice from the loft, "but I ain't had
time to throw it back since you threw it up for yesterday's
delegation."</p>

<p>The quick wit of a traveling salesman who has since become a
well-known merchant was severely tested one day. He sent in his
card by the office-boy to the manager of a large concern, whose
inner office was separated from the waiting-room by a ground-glass
partition. When the boy handed his card to the manager the salesman
saw him impatiently tear it in half and throw it in the
waste-basket; the boy came out and told the caller that he could
not see the chief. The salesman told the boy to go back and get him
his card; the boy brought out five cents, with the message that his
card was torn up. Then the salesman took out another card and sent
the boy back, saying: "Tell your boss I sell two cards for five
cents."</p>
<p>He got his interview and sold a large bill of goods.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A young man entered a hat store and asked to see the latest
styles in derbies. He was evidently hard to please, for soon the
counter was covered with hats that he had tried on and found
wanting. At last the salesman picked up a brown derby, brushed it
off on his sleeve, and extended it admiringly.</p>
<p>"These are being very much worn this season, sir," he said.
"Won't you try it on?"</p>
<p>The customer put the hat on and surveyed himself critically in
the mirror. "You're sure it's in style?"</p>
<p>"The most fashionable thing we have in the shop, sir. And it
suits you to perfection&mdash;if the fit's right."</p>
<p>"Yes, it fits very well. So you think I had better have it?"</p>
<p>"I don't think you could do better."</p>
<p>"No, I don't think I could. So I guess I won't buy a new one
after all."</p>
<p>The salesman had been boosting the customer's old hat, which had
become mixed among the many new ones.</p>

<p>In a small South Carolina town that was "finished" before the

traveling man who was making his first trip to the town was
watching the game, and, not being acquainted with the business
methods of the citizens, he called the attention of the owner of
the store to some customers who had just entered the front

checkerboard. "Keep perfectly quiet and they'll go out."</p>

<p>An Episcopal missionary in Wyoming visited one of the outlying

the home of a large family not conspicuous for its piety. He made
known his intentions to the woman of the house, and she murmured
vaguely that "she'd go out and see." She was long in returning, and
after a tiresome wait the missionary went to the door and called
with some impatience:</p>
<p>"Aren't you coming in? Don't you care anything about your

him:</p>
<p>"You speak of everybody having a mission. What is yours?"</p>

<p>According to the following story, economy has its pains as well

<p>One spring, for some reason, old Eli was going round town with
the face of dissatisfaction, and, when questioned, poured forth his
voluble tale of woe thus:</p>

air.</p>
<p>"Why, save up a thousand dollars, and have it safe in the bank,
and then I'll marry you."</p>
<p>About two months later she cuddled up close to him on the sofa
one evening, and said:</p>
<p>"Robert dear, have you saved up that thousand yet?"</p>
<p>"Why, no, my love," he replied; "not all of it."</p>
<p>"How much have you saved, darling?"</p>
<p>"Just two dollars and thirty-five cents, dear."</p>

<h3>SCHOLARSHIP</h3>
<p>There is in Washington an old "grouch' whose son was graduated
from Yale. When the young man came home at the end of his first
term, he exulted in the fact that he stood next to the head of his
class. But the old gentleman was not satisfied.</p>
<p>"<i>Next</i> to the head!" he exclaimed. "What do you mean? I'd
like to know what you think I'm sending you to college for?
<i>Next</i> to the head! Why aren't you at the head, where you
ought to be?"</p>
<p>At this the son was much crestfallen; but upon his return, he
went about his work with such ambition that at the end of the term
he found himself in the coveted place. When he went home that year
he felt very proud. It would be great news for the old man.</p>
<p>When the announcement was made, the father contemplated his son
for a few minutes in silence; then, with a shrug, he remarked:</p>
<p>"At the head of the class, eh? Well, that's a fine commentary on
Yale University!"&mdash;<i>Howard Morse</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Well, there were only three boys in school to-day who could
answer one question that the teacher asked us," said a proud boy of
eight.</p>
<p>"And I hope my boy was one of the three," said the proud
mother.</p>
<p>"Well, I was," answered Young Hopeful, "and Sam Harris and Harry
Stone were the other two."</p>
<p>"I am very glad you proved yourself so good a scholar, my son;
it makes your mother proud of you. What question did the teacher
ask, Johnnie?"</p>
<p>"'Who broke the glass in the back window?'"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Sammy's mother was greatly distressed because he had such poor
marks in his school work. She scolded, coaxed, even promised him a
dime if he would do better. The next day he came running home.</p>
<p>"Oh, mother," he shouted, "I got a hundred!"</p>
<p>"And what did you get a hundred in?"</p>
<p>"In two things," replied Sammy without hesitation. "I got forty
in readin' and sixty in spellin'."</p>

<h3>SHYNESS</h3>
<p>The late "lan Maclaren" (Dr. John Watson) once told this story
on himself to some friends:</p>
<p>"I was coming over on the steamer to America, when one day I
went into the library to do some literary work. I was very busy and
looked so, I suppose. I had no sooner started to write than a
diffident-looking young man plumped into the chair opposite me,
began twirling his cap and stared at me. I let him sit there. An
hour or more passed, and he was still there, returning my
occasional and discouraging glances at him with a foolish,
ingratiating smile. I was inclined to be annoyed. I had a suspicion
that he was a reader of my books, perhaps an admirer&mdash;or an
autograph-hunter. He could wait. But at last he rose, and still
twirling his cap, he spoke:</p>
<p>"'Excuse me, Doctor Watson; I'm getting deathly sick in here and
I'm real sorry to disturb you, but I thought you'd like to know
that just as soon as you left her Mrs. Watson fell down the
companionway stairs, and I guess she hurt herself pretty
badly.'"</p>

<h3>SIGNS</h3>
<p>When the late Senator Wolcott first went to Colorado he and his
brother opened a law office at Idaho Springs under the firm name of
"Ed. Wolcott &amp; Bro." Later the partnership was dissolved.
The future senator packed his few assets, including the sign that
had hung outside of his office, upon a burro and started for
Georgetown, a mining town farther up in the hills. Upon his arrival
he was greeted by a crowd of miners who critically surveyed him and
his outfit. One of them, looking first at the sign that hung over
the pack, then at Wolcott, and finally at the donkey, ventured:</p>
<p>"Say, stranger, which of you is Ed?"</p>

<p>"Buck" Kilgore, of Texas, who once kicked open the door of the
House of Representatives when Speaker Reed had all doors locked to
prevent the minority from leaving the floor and thus escaping a
vote, was noted for his indifference to forms and rules. Speaker
Reed, annoyed by members bringing lighted cigars upon the floor of
the House just before opening time, had signs conspicuously posted
as follows: "No smoking on the floor of the House." One day just
before convening the House his eagle eye detected Kilgore
nonchalantly puffing away at a fat cigar. Calling a page, he told
him to give his compliments to the gentleman from Texas and ask him
if he had not seen the signs. After a while the page returned and
seated himself without reporting to the Speaker, and Mr. Reed was
irritated to see the gentleman from Texas continue his smoke. With
a frown he summoned the page and asked:</p>
<p>"Did you tell the gentleman from Texas what I said?"</p>
<p>"I did," replied the page.</p>
<p>"What did he say?" asked Reed.</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;er," stammered the page, "he said to give his
compliments to you and tell you he did not believe in signs."</p>

playing a closely contested game of golf. He carefully teed up his
ball and addressed it with the most aproved grace; he raised his
driver and hit the ball a tremendous clip, but instead of soaring
into the azure it perversely went about twelve feet to the right
and then buzzed around in a circle. The clerical gentleman frowned,
scowled, pursed up his mouth and bit his lips, but said nothing,
and a friend who stood by him said: "Doctor, that is the most
profane silence I ever witnessed."</p>

<p>A visiting clergyman was occupying a pulpit in St. Louis one
Sunday when it was the turn of the bass to sing a solo, which he
did very badly, to the annoyance of the preacher, a lover of music.
When the singer fell back in his seat, red of face and exhausted,
the clergyman arose, placed his hands on the unopened Bible,
deliberately surveyed the faces of the congregation, and announced
the text:</p>
<p>"And the wind ceased and there was a great calm."</p>

Miss Jeanette Gilder was one of the ardent enthusiasts at the debut

<p>"She is a great singer unquestionably," responded her more
phlegmatic friend, "but the registers of her voice are not so even
as, for instance, Melba's."</p>
<p>"Oh, bother Melba," said Miss Gilder. "Tetrazzini gives

contributed to the evening's entertainment but a certain Doctor
MacDonald.</p>
<p>"Come, come, Doctor MacDonald," said the chairman, "we cannot

<p>The doctor protested that he could not sing.</p>
<p>"My voice is altogether unmusical, and resembles the sound
caused by the act of rubbing a brick along the panels of a
door."</p>
<p>The company attributed this to the doctor's modesty. Good
singers, he was reminded, always needed a lot of pressing.</p>
<p>"Very well," said the doctor, "if you can stand it I will
sing."</p>
<p>Long before he had finished his audience was uneasy.</p>
<p>There was a painful silence as the doctor sat down, broken at
length by the voice of a braw Scot at the end of the table.</p>

<h3>SLEEP</h3>
<p>Recently a friend who had heard that I sometimes suffer from
insomnia told me of a sure cure. "Eat a pint of peanuts and drink
two or three glasses of milk before going to bed," said he, "and
I'll warrant you'll be asleep within half an hour." I did as he
suggested, and now for the benefit of others who may be afflicted
with insomnia, I feel it my duty to report what happened, so far as
I am able to recall the details.</p>
<p>First, let me say my friend was right. I did go to sleep very
soon after my retirement. Then a friend with his head under his arm
came along and asked me if I wanted to buy his feet. I was
negotiating with him, when the dragon on which I was riding slipped
out of his skin and left me floating in mid-air. While I was
considering how I should get down, a bull with two heads peered
over the edge of the wall and said he would haul me up if I would
first climb up and rig a windlass for him. So as I was sliding down
the mountainside the brakeman came in, and I asked him when the
train would reach my station.</p>
<p>"We passed your station four hundred years ago," he said, calmly
folding the train up and slipping it into his vest pocket.</p>
<p>At this juncture the clown bounded into the ring and pulled the
center-pole out of the ground, lifting the tent and all the people
in it up, up, while I stood on the earth below watching myself go
out of sight among the clouds above. Then I awoke, and found I had
been asleep almost ten minutes.&mdash;<i>The Good Health

<h3>SNEEZING</h3>
<p>While campaigning in Iowa Speaker Cannon was once inveigled into
visiting the public schools of a town where he was billed to speak.
In one of the lower grades an ambitious teacher called upon a
youthful Demosthenes to entertain the distinguished visitor with an
exhibition of amateur oratory. The selection attempted was Byron's
"Battle of Waterloo," and just as the boy reached the end of the
first paragraph Speaker Cannon gave vent to a violent sneeze. "But,
hush! hark!" declaimed the youngster; "a deep sound strikes like a
rising knell! Did ye not hear it?"</p>
<p>The visitors smiled and a moment later the second
sneeze&mdash;which the Speaker was vainly trying to hold
back&mdash;came with increased violence.</p>
<p>"But, hark!" bawled the boy, "that heavy sound breaks in once
more, and nearer, clearer, deadlier than before! Arm! arm! it
is&mdash;it is&mdash;the cannon's opening roar!"</p>
<p>This was too much, and the laugh that broke from the party
swelled to a roar when "Uncle Joe" chuckled: "Put up yout weapons,
children; I won't shoot any more."</p>

<p>Alphonse was as good a servant as one would wish to employ, and
as his socialism never got farther than attending a weekly meeting,
the baron never objected to his political faith. After a few months
of these permissions to absent himself from duty, his employer
noticed one week that he did not ask to go. The baron thought
Alphonse might have forgotten the night, but when the next week he
stayed at home, he inquired what was up.</p>
<p>"Sir," said the valet, with the utmost dignity, "some of my
former colleagues have worked out a calculation that if all the
wealth in France were divided equally per capita, each individual
would be the possessor of two thousand francs."</p>
<p>Then he stopped as if that told the whole story, so said the
baron, "What of that?"</p>
<p>"Sir," came back from the enlightened Alphonse, "I have five
thousand francs now."&mdash;<i>Warwick James Price</i>.</p>

<h3>STAMMERING</h3>
<p>One of the ushers approached a man who appeared to be annoying
those about him.</p>
<p>"Don't you like the show?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed!"</p>
<p>"Then why do you persist in hissing the performers?"</p>
<p>"Why, m-man alive, I w-was-n't h-hissing! I w-was s-s-im-ply

<p>An earnest preacher in Georgia, who has a custom of telling the

help against the progress of wickedness in his town, with the
statement:</p>

statistics."</p>

cases like yours, one per cent invariably recovers. I've treated
ninety-nine cases, and every one of them died. Why, man alive, you

<p>A bird dog belonging to a man in Mulvane disappeared last week.
The owner put this "ad" in the paper and insisted that it be
printed exactly as he wrote it:</p>
<p>LOST OR RUN AWAY&mdash;One livver culered burd dog called Jim.

<p>"Oh, they didn't send any names. They all said, 'She'll know
where they come from.'"</p>

<p>The little girl was having a great deal of trouble pronouncing
some of the words she met with. "Vinegar" had given her the most
trouble, and she was duly grieved to know that the village was
being entertained by her efforts in this direction.</p>
<p>She was sent one day to the store with the vinegar-jug, to get
it filled, and had no intention of amusing the people who were
gathered in the store. So she handed the jug to the clerk with:</p>
<p>"Smell the mouth of it and give me a quart."</p>

<p>A young couple had been courting for several years, and the
young man seemed to be in no hurry to marry. Finally, one day, he
said:</p>
<p>"Sall, I canna marry thee."</p>
<p>"How's that?" asked she.</p>
<p>"I've changed my mind," said he.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll tell thee what we'll do," said she. "If folks know
that it's thee as has given me up I shanna be able to get another
chap; but if they think I've given thee up then I can get all I
want. So we'll have banns published and when the wedding day comes
the parson will say to thee, 'Wilt thou have this woman to be thy
wedded wife?' and thou must say, 'I will.' And when he says to me,
'Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband?' I shall say, 'I
winna.'"</p>
<p>The day came, and when the minister asked the important question
the man answered:</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>Then the parson said to the woman:</p>
<p>"Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband?" and she
said:</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>"Why," said the young man furiously, "you said you would say 'I

<p>"I know that," said the young woman, "but I've changed my mind
since."</p>

<p>Charles Stuart, formerly senator from Michigan, was traveling by
stage through his own state. The weather was bitter cold, the snow
deep, and the roads practically unbroken. The stage was nearly an
hour late at the dinner station and everybody was cross and
hungry.</p>
<p>In spite of the warning, "Ten minutes only for refreshments,"
Senator Stuart sat down to dinner with his usual deliberation. When
he had finished his first cup of coffee the other passengers were
leaving the table. By the time his second cup arrived the stage was
at the door. "All aboard!" shouted the driver. The senator lingered
and called for a third cup of coffee.</p>
<p>While the household, as was the custom, assembled at the door to
see the stage oft, the senator calmly continued his meal. Suddenly,
just as the stage was starting, he pounded violently on the
dining-room table. The landlord hurried in. The senator wanted a
dish of rice-pudding. When it came he called for a spoon. There
wasn't a spoon to be found.</p>
<p>"That shock-headed fellow took 'em!" exclaimed the landlady. "I
knew him for a thief the minute I laid eyes on him."</p>
<p>The landlord jumped to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>"Hustle after that stage!" he shouted to the sheriff, who was
untying his horse from the rail in front of the tavern. "Bring 'em
all back. They've taken the silver!"</p>
<p>A few minutes later the stage, in charge of the sheriff, swung
around in front of the house. The driver was in a fury.</p>
<p>"Search them passengers!" insisted the landlord.</p>
<p>But before the officer could move, the senator opened the stage
door, stepped inside, then leaned out, touched the sheriff's arm
and whispered:</p>
<p>"Tell the landlord he'll find his spoons in the coffee-pot."</p>

<h3>SUBWAYS</h3>
<p>Any one who has ever traveled on the New York subway in rush
hours can easily appreciate the following:</p>
<p>A little man, wedged into the middle of a car, suddenly thought
of pickpockets, and quite as suddenly remembered that he had some
money in his overcoat. He plunged his hand into his pocket and was
somewhat shocked upon encountering the fist of a fat
fellow-passenger.</p>
<p>"Aha!" snorted the latter. "I caught you that time!"</p>
<p>"Leggo!" snarled the little man. "Leggo my hand!"</p>
<p>"Pickpocket!" hissed the fat man.</p>
<p>"Scoundrel!" retorted the little one.</p>
<p>Just then a tall man in their vicinity glanced up from his
paper.</p>
<p>"I'd like to get off here," he drawled, "if you fellows don't
mind taking your hands out of my pocket."</p>

exercise and by that time the Human Steamboat returned. He wore a
pair of swimming trunks and had a sheet iron cook stove strapped on
his back. Tied around his neck were a dozen packages containing
bread, flour, bacon and other eatables. The Whale gazed at his

friend. It was a small house, not well built, and as he walked
about in his room the unsubstantial little house fairly shook with
his tread. When he got into bed that receptacle, unused to so much
weight, gave way, precipitating Taft on the floor.</p>
<p>His friend hurried to his door.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Bill?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm all right, I guess," Taft called out to his friend
good-naturedly; "but say, Joe, if you don't find me here in the
morning look in the cellar."</p>

<h3>TALKERS</h3>
<p>Some years ago, Mark Twain was a guest of honor at an opera
box-party given by a prominent member of New York society. The
hostess had been particularly talkative all during the
performance&mdash;to Mr. Clemens's increasing irritation.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the opera, she turned to him and said
gushingly:</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear Mr. Clemens, I do so want you to be with us next
Friday evening. I'm certain you will like it the opera will be
'Tosca.'"</p>
<p>"Charmed, I'm sure," replied Clemens. "I've never heard you in
that."</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening and Ole, who had screwed up courage
to take Mary for a ride, was carried away by the magic of the
night.</p>
<p>"Mary," he asked, "will you marry me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Ole," she answered softly.</p>
<p>Ole lapsed into a silence that at last became painful to his
fianc&eacute;e.</p>
<p>"Ole," she said desperately, "why don't you say something?"</p>
<p>"Ay tank," Ole replied, "they bane too much said already."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Sir," said the sleek-looking agent, approaching the desk of the
meek, meaching-looking man and opening one of those folding
thingumjigs showing styles of binding, "I believe I can interest
you in this massive set of books containing the speeches of the
world's greatest orators. Seventy volumes, one dollar down and one
dollar a month until the price, six hundred and eighty dollars has
been paid. This set of books gives you the most celebrated speeches
of the greatest talkers the world has ever known and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Let me see the index," said the meek man.</p>
<p>The agent handed it to him and he looked through it carefully
and methodically, running his finger along the list of names.</p>
<p>Reaching the end he handed the index back to the agent and said:
"It isn't what you claim it is. I happen to know the greatest
talker in the world, and you haven't her in the index."</p>

<p>A guest was expected for dinner and Bobby had received five
cents as the price of his silence during the meal. He was as quiet
as a mouse until, discovering that his favorite dessert was being
served, he could no longer curb his enthusiasm. He drew the coin
from his pocket, and rolling it across the table, exclaimed:
"Here's your nickel, Mamma. I'd rather talk."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A belated voyager in search of hilarity stumbled home after one
o'clock and found his wife waiting for him. The curtain lecture
that followed was of unusual virulence, and in the midst of it he
fell asleep. Awakening a few hours later he found his wife still
pouring forth a regular cascade of denunciation. Eyeing her
sleepily he said curiously,</p>
<p>"Say, are you talking yet or again?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"You must not talk all the time, Ethel," said the mother who had
been interrupted.</p>
<p>"When will I be old enough to, Mama?" asked the little girl.</p>

<p>While the late Justice Brewer was judge in a minor court he was
presiding at the trial of a wife's suit for separation and alimony.
The defendant acknowledged that he hadn't spoken to his wife in
five years, and Judge Brewer put in a question.</p>
<p>"What explanation have you," he asked severely, "for not
speaking to your wife in five years?"</p>
<p>"Your Honor," replied the husband, "I didn't like to interrupt
the lady."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>She was in an imaginative mood.</p>
<p>"Henry, dear," she said after talking two hours without a
recess, "I sometimes wish I were a mermaid."</p>
<p>"It would be fatal," snapped her weary hubby.</p>
<p>"Fatal! In what way?"</p>
<p>"Why, you couldn't keep your mouth closed long enough to keep
from drowning."</p>

<p>A street-car was getting under way when two women, rushing from
opposite sides of the street to greet each other, met right in the
middle of the car-track and in front of the car. There the two
stopped and began to talk. The car stopped, too, but the women did
not appear to realize that it was there. Certain of the passengers,
whose heads were immediately thrust out of the windows to ascertain
what the trouble was, began to make sarcastic remarks, but the two
women heeded them not.</p>
<p>Finally the motorman showed that he had a saving sense of humor.
Leaning over the dash-board, he inquired, in the gentlest of
tones:</p>
<p>"Pardon me, ladies, but shall I get you a couple of chairs?"</p>
<hr class="short" />

sorely a week ago. She has not spoken a syllable to me since."</p>

<p>"It isn't wise for a painter to be too frank in his criticisms,"
said Robert Henri at a luncheon. "I know a very outspoken painter
whose little daughter called at a friend's house and said:</p>
<p>'Show me your new parlor rug, won't you, please?'"</p>
<p>So, with great pride, the hostess led the little girl into the
drawing-room, and raised all the blinds, so that the light might
stream in abundantly upon the gorgeous colors of an expensive
Kirmanshah.</p>
<p>The little girl stared down at the rug in silence. Then, as she
turned away, she said in a rather disappointed voice:</p>
<p>"'It doesn't make <i>me</i> sick!'"</p>

<h3>TEACHERS</h3>
<p>A rural school has a pretty girl as its teacher, but she was
much troubled because many of her pupils were late every morning.
At last she made the announcement that she would kiss the first
pupil to arrive at the schoolhouse the next morning. At sunrise the
largest three boys of her class were sitting on the doorstep of the
schoolhouse, and by six o'clock every boy in the school and four of
the directors were waiting for her to arrive.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Why did you break your engagement with that school
teacher?"</p>
<p>"If I failed to show up at her house every evening, she expected
me to bring a written excuse signed by my mother."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Among the youngsters belonging to a colege settlement in a New
England city was one little girl who returned to her humble home
with glowing accounts of the new teacher.</p>
<p>"She's a perfect lady," exclaimed the enthusiastic
youngster.</p>
<p>The child's mother gave her a doubtful look. "How do <i>you</i>
know?" she said. "You've only known her two days."</p>
<p>"It's easy enough tellin'," continued the child. "I know she's a
perfect lady, because she makes you feel polite all the time."</p>

<p>MOTHER&mdash;"The teacher complains you have not had a correct
lesson for a month; why is it?"</p>
<p>SON&mdash;"She always kisses me when I get them right."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There was a meeting of the new teachers and the old. It was a
sort of love feast, reception or whatever you call it. Anyhow all
the teachers got together and pretended they didn't have a care in
the world. After the eats were et the symposiarch proposed a
toast:</p>
<p>"Long Live Our Teachers!"</p>
<p>It was drunk enthusiastically. One of the new teachers was
called on to respond. He modestly accepted. His answer was:</p>
<p>"What On?"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>TEACHER&mdash;"Now, Willie, where did you get that chewing gum?

<h3>TEARS</h3>
<p>Two Irishmen who had just landed were eating their dinner in a
hotel, when Pat spied a bottle of horseradish. Not knowing what it
was he partook of a big mouthful, which brought tears to his
eyes.</p>
<p>Mike, seeing Pat crying, exclaimed: "Phat be ye cryin' fer?"</p>
<p>Pat, wishing to have Mike fooled also, exclaimed: "I'm crying
fer me poor ould mother, who's dead way over in Ireland."</p>
<p>By and by Mike took some of the radish, whereupon tears filled
<i>his</i> eyes. Pat, seeing them, asked his friend what he was
crying for.</p>
<p>Mike replied: "Because ye didn't die at the same time yer poor

<p>The dentist quietly told his office boy to prick his patient
with a pin, and when Pat opened his mouth to yell the dentist
seized the tooth, and out it came.</p>
<p>"It didn't hurt as much as you expected it would, did it?" the
dentist asked smiling.</p>
<p>"Well, no," replied Pat hesitatingly, as if doubting the
truthfulness of his admission. "But," he added, placing his hand on

<h3>TELEPHONE</h3>
<p>Two girls were talking over the wire. Both were discussing what
they should wear to the Christmas party. In the midst of this
important conversation a masculine voice interrupted, asking humbly
for a number. One of the girls became indignant and scornfully
asked:</p>
<p>"What line do you think you are on, anyhow?"</p>
<p>"Well," said the man, "I am not sure, but, judging from what I
have heard, I should say I was on a clothesline."</p>

<p>When Grover Cleveland's little girl was quite young her father
once telephoned to the White House from Chicago and asked Mrs.
Cleveland to bring the child to the 'phone. Lifting the little one
up to the instrument, Mrs. Cleveland watched her expression change
from bewilderment to wonder and then to fear. It was surely her
father's voice&mdash;yet she looked at the telephone incredulously.
After examining the tiny opening in the receiver the little girl
burst into tears. "Oh, Mamma!" she sobbed. "How can we ever get

<h3>TEMPERANCE</h3>
<p>A Boston deacon who was a zealous advocate for the cause of
temperance employed a carpenter to make some alterations in his
home. In repairing a corner near the fireplace, it was found
necessary to remove the wainscot, when some things were brought to
light which greatly astonished the workman. A brace of decanters,
sundry bottles containing "something to take," a pitcher, and
tumblers were cosily reposing in their snug quarters. The joiner
ran to the proprietor with the intelligence.</p>
<p>"Well, I declare!" exclaimed the deacon. "That is curious, sure
enough. It must be old Captain Bunce that left those things there
when he occupied the premises thirty years since."</p>

<p>A Michigan citizen recently received a letter from a Kentucky
whisky house, requesting him to send them the names of a dozen or
more persons who would like to get some fine whisky shipped to them
at a very low price. The letter wound up by saying:</p>
<p>"We will give you a commission on all the orders sent in by
parties whose names you send us."</p>
<p>The Michigan man belonged to a practical joke class, and filled
in the names of some of his prohibition friends on the blank spaces
left for that purpose.</p>
<p>He had forgotten all about his supposed practical joke when
Monday he received another letter from the same house. He supposed
it was a request for some more names, and was just about to throw
the communication in the waste basket when it occurred to him to
send the name of another old friend to the whisky house. He
accordingly tore open the envelope, and came near collapsing when
he found a check for $4.80, representing his commission on the sale
of whisky to the parties whose names he had sent in about three
weeks before.</p>

<h3>TEXTS</h3>
<p>In the Tennessee mountains a mountaineer preacher, who had
declared colleges "the works of the devil," was preaching without
previous meditation an inspirational sermon from the text, "The
voice of the turtle shall be heard in the land." Not noting that
the margin read "turtle-dove," he proceeded in this manner:</p>
<p>"This text, my hearers, strikes me as one of the most peculiar
texts in the whole book, because we all know that a turtle ain't
got no voice. But by the inward enlightenment I begin to see the
meaning and will expose it to you. Down in the hollers by the
streams and ponds you have gone in the springtime, my brethren, and
observed the little turtles, a-sleeping on the logs. But at the
sound of the approach of a human being, they went
<i>kerflop-kerplunk</i>, down into the water. This I say, then, is
the meaning of the prophet: he, speakinging figgeratively, referred
to the <i>kerflop</i> of the turtle as the <i>voice</i> of the
turtle, and hence we see that in those early times the prophet,
looking down at the ages to come, clearly taught and prophesied the
doctrine I have always preached to this congregation&mdash;<i>that
immersion is the only form of baptism."</i></p>

verse from the Twenty-third Psalm: 'The Lord is my shepherd.' Would
that seem appropriate?"</p>
<p>"Quite," said the clergyman; "but do you really want an
appropriate verse?"</p>
<p>"I certainly do," was the reply.</p>
<p>"Well, then," said the clergyman, with a twinkle in his eye, "I
would select the verse in the same Psalm: 'Thou anointest my head
with oil; my cup runneth over.'"</p>

resembled a succession of pistol-shots was heard off the wings.</p>
<p>"What on earth are you doing, man?" shouted the manager, rushing
behind the scenes. "Do you call that thunder? It's not a bit like
it."</p>
<p>"Awfully sorry, sir," responded the carpenter; "but the fact is,
sir, I couldn't hear you because of the storm. That was real
thunder, sir!"</p>

<h3>TIPS</h3>
<p>American travelers in Europe experience a great deal of trouble
from the omnipresent need of tipping those from whom they expect
any service, however slight. They are very apt to carry it much too
far, or else attempt to resist it altogether. There is a story told
of a wealthy and ostentatious American in a Parisian restaurant. As
the waiter placed the order before him he said in a loud voice:</p>
<p>"Waiter, what is largest tip you ever received?"</p>
<p>"One thousand francs, monsieur."</p>
<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>! But I will give you two thousand," answered the
upholder of American honor; and then in a moment he added: "May I
ask who gave you the thousand francs?"</p>
<p>"It was yourself, monsieur," said the obsequious waiter.</p>
<p>Of quite an opposite mode of thought was another American
visiting London for the first time. Goaded to desperation by the
incessant necessity for tips, he finally entered the washroom of
his hotel, only to be faced with a large sign which read: "Please
tip the basin after using." "I'm hanged if I will!" said the
Yankee, turning on his heel, "I'll go dirty first!"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Grant Alien relates that he was sitting one day under the shade
of the Sphinx, turning for some petty point of detail to his
Baedeker.</p>
<p>A sheik looked at him sadly, and shook his head. "Murray good,"
he said in a solemn voice of warning; "Baedeker no good. What for
you see Baedeker?"</p>
<p>"No, no; Baedeker is best," answered Mr. Alien. "Why do you
object to Baedeker?"</p>
<p>The shick crossed his hands, and looked down at him with the
pitying eyes of Islam. "Baedeker bad book," he repeated; "Murray
very, very good. Murray say, 'Give the sheik half a crown';
Baedeker say, 'Give the sheik a shilling.'"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"What do you consider the most important event in the history of
Paris?"</p>
<p>"Well," replied the tourist, who had grown weary of distributing
tips, "so far as financial prosperity is concerned, I should say
the discovery of America was the making of this town."</p>

<p>In telling this one, Miss Glaser always states that she does not
want it understood that she considers the Scotch people at all
stingy; but they are a very careful and thrifty race.</p>
<p>An intimate friend of her's was very anxious to have a well
known Scotchman meet Miss Glaser, and gave her a letter of
introduction to him. Miss Glaser, wishing to show him all the
attention possible, invited him to a dinner which she was giving in
London and after rather an elaborate repast the bill was paid, the
waiter returning five shillings. She let it lie, intending, of
course, to give it to the waiter. The Scotchman glanced at the
money very frequently, and finally he said, his natural thrift
getting the best of him:</p>
<p>"Are you going to give all that to the waiter?"</p>
<p>In a inimitable way, Miss Glaser quietly replied:</p>
<p>"No, take some."</p>

<h3>TITLES OF HONOR AND NOBILITY</h3>
<p>An English lord was traveling through this country with a small

she was entertaining nobility, was nearly overcome with surprise

<p>While seated at the table scarcely a moment's peace did she
grant her distinguished guest in her endeavor to serve and please
him. It was "My Lord, will you have some of this?" and "My Lord, do
try that," "Take a piece of this, my Lord," until the meal was
nearly finished.</p>
<p>The little four-year-old son of the family, heretofore

<h3>TREASON</h3>
<p>It was during the Parnell agitation in Ireland that an
anti-Parnellite, criticising the ways of tenants in treating
absentee landlords, exclaimed to Archbishop Ryan of Philadelphia:
"Why, it looks very much like treason."</p>
<p>Instantly came the answer in the Archbishop's best brogue:
"Sure, treason is reason when there's an absent 't'."</p>

<p>A reputable citizen had left four umbrellas to be repaired. At
noon he had luncheon in a restaurant, and as he was departing he
absent-mindedly started to take an umbrella from a hook near his
hat.</p>
<p>"That's mine, sir," said a woman at the next table.</p>
<p>He apologized and went out. When he was going home in a street
car with his four repaired umbrellas, the woman he had seen in the
restaurant got in. She glanced from him to his umbrellas and
said:</p>
<p>"I see you had a good day."</p>

if he was going as far as my house I would beg the shelter of his

that umbrella, young fellow?' and he dropped the umbrella and
ran."</p>

<p>One day a man exhibited a handsome umbrella. "It's wonderful how
I make things last," he exclaimed. "Look at this umbrella, now. I

hands and feet, and his vocal organs, rapidly developing, are wont
to cause his voice to undergo sudden and involuntary changes from
high treble to low bass.</p>
<p>In an authoritative rumbling bass voice he demanded of the busy
clerk, "Give me a can of corn" (then, his voice suddenly changing
to a shrill falsetto, he continued) "and a sack of flour."</p>

<h3>WEDDING PRESENTS</h3>
<p>Among the presents lately showered upon a dusky bride in a rural
section of Virginia, was one that was a gift of an old woman with
whom both bride and groom were great favorites.</p>
<p>Some time ago, it appears, the old woman accumulated a supply of
cardboard mottoes, which she worked and had framed as occasion
arose.</p>
<p>So it happened that in a neat combination of blues and reds,
suspended by a cord of orange, there hung over the table whereon
the other presents were displayed for the delectation of the
wedding guests, this motto:</p>
<p class="center">FIGHT ON; FIGHT EVER.</p>

<h3>WEDDINGS</h3>
<p>An actor who was married recently for the third time, and whose
bride had been married once before, wrote across the bottom of the
wedding invitations: "Be sure and come; this is no amateur
performance."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A wealthy young woman from the west was recently wedded to a
member of the nobility of England, and the ceremony occurred in the
most fashionable of London churches&mdash;St. George's.</p>
<p>Among the guests was a cousin of the bride, as sturdy an
American as can be imagined. He gave an interesting summary of the
wedding when asked by a girl friend whether the marriage was a
happy one.</p>
<p>"Happy? I should say it was," said the cousin. "The bride was
happy, her mother was overjoyed, Lord Stickleigh, the groom, was in
ecstasies, and his creditors, I understand, were in a state of
absolute bliss."&mdash;<i>Edwun Tarrisse</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The best man noticed that one of the wedding guests, a
gloomy-looking young man, did not seem to be enjoying himself. He
was wandering about as though he had lost his last friend. The best
man took it upon himself to cheer him up.</p>
<p>"Er&mdash;have you kissed the bride?" he asked by way of
introduction.</p>
<p>"Not lately," replied the gloomy one with a far-away
expression.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The curate of a large and fashionable church was endeavoring to
teach the significance of white to a Sunday-school class.</p>
<p>"Why," said he, "does a bride invariably desire to be clothed in
white at her marriage?"</p>
<p>As no one answered, he explained. "White," said he, "stands for
joy, and the wedding-day is the most joyous occasion of a woman's
life."</p>
<p>A small boy queried, "Why do the men all wear
black?"&mdash;<i>M.J. Moor</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Lilly May came to her mistress. "Ah would like a week's
vacation, Miss Annie," she said, in her soft negro accent; "Ah
wants to be married."</p>
<p>Lillie had been a good girl, so her mistress gave her the week's
vacation, a white dress, a veil and a plum-cake.</p>
<p>Promptly at the end of the week Lillie returned, radiant. "Oh,
Miss Annie!" she exclaimed, "Ah was the mos' lovely bride! Ma dress
was pcrfec', ma veil mos' lovely, the cake mos' good! An' oh, the
dancin' an' the eatin'!"</p>
<p>"Well, Lillie, this sounds delightful," said her mistress, "but
you have left out the point of your story&mdash;I hope you have a
good husband."</p>
<p>Lillie's tone changed to indignation: "Now, Miss Annie, what yo'
think? Tha' darn nigger nebber turn up!"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>There is living in Illinois a solemn man who is often funny
without meaning to be. At the time of his wedding, he lived in a
town some distance from the home of the bride. The wedding was to
be at her house. On the eventful day the solemn man started for the
station, but on the way met the village grocer, who talked so
entertainingly that the bridegroom missed his train.</p>
<p>Naturally he was in a "state." Something must be done, and done
quickly. So he sent the following telegram:</p>

<h3>WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</h3>
<p>"Didn't I tell ye to feed that cat a pound of meat every day
until ye had her fat?" demanded an Irish shopkeeper, nodding toward
a sickly, emaciated cat that was slinking through the store.</p>
<p>"Ye did thot," replied the assistant, "an" I've just been after
feedin' her a pound of meat this very minute."</p>
<p>"Faith, an' I don't believe ye. Bring me the scales."</p>
<p>The poor cat was lifted into the scales. Thy balancd at exactly
one pound.</p>
<p>"There!" exclaimed the assistant triumphantly. "Didn't I tell ye
she'd had her pound of meat?"</p>
<p>"That's right," admitted the boss, scratching his head. "That's
yer pound of meat all right. But"&mdash;suddenly looking

<h3>WELCOMES</h3>
<p>When Ex-President Taft was on his transcontinental tour,
American flags and Taft pictures were in evidence everywhere.
Usually the Taft pictures contained a word of welcome under them.
Those who heard the President's laugh ring out will not soon forget
the western city which, directly under the barred window of the
city lockup, displayed a Taft picture with the legend "Welcome" on
it.&mdash;<i>Hugh Morist</i>.</p>

<h3>WHISKY</h3>
<p>This is from an Irish priest's sermon, as quoted in Samuel M.
Hussey's "Reminiscences of an Irish Land Agent": "'It's whisky
makes you bate your wives; it's whisky makes your homes desolate;
it's whisky makes you shoot your landlords, and'&mdash;with
emphasis, as he thumped the pulpit&mdash;'it's whisky makes you
miss them.'"</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>In a recent trial of a "bootlegger" in western Kentucky a
witness testified that he had purchased some "squirrel" whisky from
the defendant.</p>
<p>"Squirrel whisky?" questioned the court.</p>
<p>"Yes, you know: the kind that makes you talk nutty and want to
climb trees."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>General Carter, who went to Texas in command of the regulars
sent south for maneuvers along the Mexican border, tells this story
of an old Irish soldier: The march had been a long and tiresome
one, and as the bivouac was being made for the night, the captain
noticed that Pat was looking very much fatigued. Thinking that a
small drop of whisky might do him good, the captain called Pat
aside and said, "Pat, will you have a wee drink of whisky?" Pat
made no answer, but folded his arms in a reverential manner and
gazed upward. The captain repeated the question several times, but
no answer from Pat, who stood silent and motionless, gazing
devoutly into the sky. Finally the captain, taking him by the
shoulder and giving him a vigorous shake said: "Pat, why don't you
answer? I said, 'Pat, will you have a drink of whisky?'" After
looking around in considerable astonishment Pat replied: "And is it
yez, captain? Begorrah and I thought it was an angel spakin' to
me."</p>

<p>Flora dried her tears.</p>

of course, I&mdash;I opened it."</p>
<p>"Of course," repeated Harry, love, dryly.</p>
<p>"It&mdash;it was written to you all the way through. Do you
understand?"</p>
<p>"I understand. But where does the insult to you come in?"</p>
<p>"It&mdash;it came in the p-p-postscript," cried the wife,
bursting into fresh floods of briny. "It s-said: 'P-P-P.

<h3>WOMAN SUFFRAGE</h3>
<p>WOMAN VOTER&mdash;"Now, I may as well be frank with you. I
absolutely refuse to vote the same ticket as that horrid Jones
woman."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Kate Douglas Wiggin was asked recently how she stood on the vote
for women question. She replied she didn't "stand at all," and told
a story about a New England farmer's wife who had no very romantic
ideas about the opposite sex, and who, hurrying from churn to sink,
from sink to shed, and back to the kitchen stove, was asked if she
wanted to vote. "No, I certainly don't! I say if there's one little
thing that the men folks can do alone, for goodness sakes let 'em
do it!" she replied.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>MR. E.N. QUIRE&mdash;"What are those women mauling that man
for?"</p>
<p>MRS. HENBALLOT&mdash;"He insulted us by saying that the suffrage
movement destroyed our naturally timid sweetness and robbed us of
all our gentleness."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Did you cast your vote, Aunty?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! Isn't it grand? A real nice gentleman with a beautiful
moustache and yellow spats marked my ballot for me. I know I should
have marked it myself, but it seemed to please him greatly."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Does your wife want to vote?"</p>
<p>"No. She wants a larger town house, a villa on the sea coast and
a new limousine car every six months. I'd be pleased most to death
if she could fix her attention on a smaller matter like the
vote."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"What you want, I suppose, is to vote, just like the men
do."</p>
<p>"Certainly not," replied Mrs. Baring-Banners. "If we couldn't do
any better than that there would be no use of our voting."</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"There's only one thing I can think of to head off this suffrage
movement," said the mere man.</p>
<p>"What is that?" asked his wife.</p>
<p>"Make the legal age for voting thirty-five instead of
twenty-one."&mdash;<i>Catholic Universe</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>MAMIE&mdash;"I believe in woman's rights."</p>
<p>GERTIE&mdash;"Then you think every woman should have a
vote?"</p>
<p>MAMIE&mdash;"No; but I think every woman should have a
voter."&mdash;<i>The Woman's Journal</i>.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>During the Presidential campaign the question of woman suffrage
was much discussed among women pro and con, and at an afternoon tea
the conversation turned that way between the women guests.</p>
<p>"Are you a woman suffragist?" asked the one who was most
interested.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I am not," replied the other most emphatically.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's too bad, but just supposing you were, whom would you
support in the present campaign?"</p>
<p>"The same man I've always supported, of course," was the apt
reply&mdash;"my husband."</p>

<p>Several men were discussing the relative importance and
difficulty of mental and physical work, and one of them told the
following experience:</p>
<p>"Several years ago, a tramp, one of the finest specimens of
physical manhood that I have ever seen, dropped into my yard and
asked me for work. The first day I put him to work helping to move
some heavy rocks, and he easily did as much work as any two other
men, and yet was as fresh as could be at the end of the day.</p>
<p>"The next morning, having no further use for him, I told him he
could go; but he begged so hard to remain that I let him go into
the cellar and empty some apple barrels, putting the good apples
into one barrel and throwing away the rotten ones&mdash;about a
half hour's work.</p>
<p>"At the end of two hours he was still in the cellar, and I went
down to see what the trouble was. I found him only half through,
but almost exhausted, beads of perspiration on his brow.</p>
<p>"'What's the matter?' I asked. 'Surely that work isn't
hard.'</p>
<p>"'No not hard,' he replied. 'But the strain on the judgment is
<i>awful</i>.'"</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
